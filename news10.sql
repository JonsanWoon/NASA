Nonetheless, we still continue to like the incentive-based regulation (IBR) framework as it offers better earnings visibility,â€ it said in a note today.Kenanga Investment Bank believes that the IBR framework will stay beyond 2019 as it is a fair and transparent mechanism.Yesterday, Gas Malaysia announced that the government had approved the half-yearly natural gas base-tariff rate revision for non-power sectors in Peninsular Malaysia to RM31.92/mmbtu on average for July-December 2018 from RM30.90/mmbtu in January-June 2018.The revision is in line with the national rationalisation plan and Gas Cost Pass-through (GCPT) announced in December 2016.In addition, under the GCPT framework, a surcharge of RM0.77/mmbtu will apply to all tariff categories due to higher actual gas costs against the reference gas costs, translating to an average effective tariff of RM32.69/mmbtu which is slightly higher than RM32.52/mmbtu for the first half of 2018.â€œThis is not a surprise to us as it is a scheduled half-yearly revision while the tariff revision has a neutral impact on Gas Malaysia on a six-month lagged basis as it is a cost pass-through under the GCPT mechanism,â€ said Kenanga Investment Bank.With the implementation of the GCPT in January 2016, which is similar to the Imbalance Cost Pass-through (ICPT) for the power sector in Peninsular Malaysia, upward revisions in natural gas tariffs are expected in the upcoming reviews until the gas price reaches market price.Kenanga Investment Bank said Gas Malaysia\'s profitability would not be affected as its profit margin spread is determined under the IBR framework based on asset return of 7.5 per cent, which is estimated at between RM1.80/mmbtu and RM2.00/mmbtu currently.â€œAs such, any price hikes will have a neutral impact on Gas Malaysia via the GCPT adjustment,â€ it added.Gas Malaysia was flat at RM2.94 as at 10.55am. â€” Bernama', '6/14/2018 3:46', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

I believe they would choose not to raise the interest rates now in order to keep the economic growth momentum.â€Slowing momentumChina reported weaker-than-expected activity data for May, adding to views the economy is finally starting to slow under the weight of a prolonged crackdown on riskier lending that is pushing up borrowing costs for companies and consumers.Beijing is into the third-year of a sweeping regulatory clampdown on riskier lending practices. Intensifying concerns over credit quality in China after a spate of corporate bond defaults over the past few months have also put the focus on financial stability.The yuan has strengthened about 1.7 per cent against the US dollar so far this year, on top of gains of about 6.8 per cent in 2017.In March, China gingerly raised market rates following the US move, in a symbolic reminder that Beijing is keeping an eye on global market trends.Policy makers are also balancing those moves by taking the brakes off some liquidity controls. Markets expect the PBOC to make another cut in banks\' reserve requirement ratios (RRR) in the second half, with some speculation it could come as early as this month or July.The PBOC\'s surprise RRR cut in April and fears of a trade war with the United States have fanned market expectations that it may loosen policy to support the economy.The Fed yesterday raised US interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point for the second time this year, and is expected to hike twice more in 2018.The PBOC has kept its benchmark one-year lending and deposit rates steady since October 2015.The central bank injected a net 70 billion yuan (RM43.6 billion) via reverse repos in open market operations today, according to the statement. â€” Reuters', '6/14/2018 3:31', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Nonetheless, we still continue to like the incentive-based regulation (IBR) framework as it offers better earnings visibility,â€ it said in a note today.Kenanga Investment Bank believes that the IBR framework will stay beyond 2019 as it is a fair and transparent mechanism.Yesterday, Gas Malaysia announced that the government had approved the half-yearly natural gas base-tariff rate revision for non-power sectors in Peninsular Malaysia to RM31.92/mmbtu on average for July-December 2018 from RM30.90/mmbtu in January-June 2018.The revision is in line with the national rationalisation plan and Gas Cost Pass-through (GCPT) announced in December 2016.In addition, under the GCPT framework, a surcharge of RM0.77/mmbtu will apply to all tariff categories due to higher actual gas costs against the reference gas costs, translating to an average effective tariff of RM32.69/mmbtu which is slightly higher than RM32.52/mmbtu for the first half of 2018.â€œThis is not a surprise to us as it is a scheduled half-yearly revision while the tariff revision has a neutral impact on Gas Malaysia on a six-month lagged basis as it is a cost pass-through under the GCPT mechanism,â€ said Kenanga Investment Bank.With the implementation of the GCPT in January 2016, which is similar to the Imbalance Cost Pass-through (ICPT) for the power sector in Peninsular Malaysia, upward revisions in natural gas tariffs are expected in the upcoming reviews until the gas price reaches market price.Kenanga Investment Bank said Gas Malaysia\'s profitability would not be affected as its profit margin spread is determined under the IBR framework based on asset return of 7.5 per cent, which is estimated at between RM1.80/mmbtu and RM2.00/mmbtu currently.â€œAs such, any price hikes will have a neutral impact on Gas Malaysia via the GCPT adjustment,â€ it added.Gas Malaysia was flat at RM2.94 as at 10.56am. â€” Bernama', '6/14/2018 3:46', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

KUALA LUMPUR, June 14 â€” Homegrown food startup Amazin\' Graze aims to expand its reach to Asian markets such as Indonesia and the Philippines as well as the United Kingdom and the United States by year-end to cater to the demand for affordable snacks.The company currently has a presence in the domestic market as well as in Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai, offering artisanal handcrafted healthy snacks that are 100 per cent natural such as granola, nut mix and nut butter.â€œBy year-end, we will have a lot of international certifications including the HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points). Once we get the certifications, we will be able to enter Indonesia and the Philippines by Christmas this year,â€ founder Amy Zheng told Bernama.She explained that the company aims to be an international food business producing healthy snacks with a target market of working adults between 25 and late 30s as well as young mothers.â€œIt is wonderful that we started in Malaysia because Malaysia has such a high taste profile. People want really tasty products. If we can capture the market here, we can easily capture international markets,â€ she notedZheng added the company depends on a bottom-up marketing strategy by collaborating with local influencers to promote their products.â€œAs a start-up, we donâ€™t have a lot of marketing budget, we don\'t spend a lot of money on tv or billboards, but we definitely work with the local influencers. We identify people who are already having intentions to live healthy, do a lot of fitness or they make healthy food.â€œWe work with them to introduce our products via their Instagram and their Facebook pages. It is very genuine marketing because it is from their word of mouth that their friends and their colleagues get to discover,â€ she added.Amazin\' Graze was established in 2015 by Zheng, Chief Operating Officer Sabrina How and Chief Marketing Officer Ching Yi Lee with the mission to change the way Malaysian consumers snack due to the lack of healthy foods in the local market.â€œWe found that there were very few options or it was mostly imported food from Australia, the US, the UK, but that was not suitable for Malaysian palette because in Malaysia, we like to eat very rich, very flavourful food and nothing in the market we saw was tailored to that,â€ said Zheng.All 600 packets of granola and nut were sold out on the first two days Amazin\' Graze hit the market in Kuala Lumpur three years ago.â€œInitial investments were not big because we wanted to start small. We rented a small facility in Sentul of about 700 sq ft,â€ said Zheng.The company recently moved to a bigger production facility in Kepong of nearly 9,000 sq ft with a capacity of two tonnes per day, helped by the company\'s becoming the second runner-up in Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd and Eco World Development Group Bhd\'s BizSmart Challenge in 2016.â€œI would say it was a starting point where our dream of having a bigger facility came about,â€ said How.Main ingredients such as oats are sourced from Australia while nuts and mulberries are imported from the US and the Middle East respectively. The company also uses local products such as palm sugar and pandan.To manage costs, How said the company has built a good relationship with its suppliers.â€œWe took a hit once. When we first started, the ringgit was a lot stronger (against the US dollar). As it hit above the 4.30-level, it hurt us a little bit because the costs increased as well. From then on we talked to our suppliers to let us know earlier when the price is expected to increase so we can book at the price that we want,â€ she added.With the initial three employees (the founders), the company currently has 40 employees with total sales at around RM500,000 per month and more during festive seasons.â€œBy the end of the year, we are looking at doubling our revenues again, we usually grow more rapidly during festive seasons,â€ explained Zheng.Meanwhile, How pointed out that the company thrives on innovation to excite its target market while aiming to introduce new products such as bars in the fourth quarter of this year and instant chia pudding next year. â€” Bernama', '6/14/2018 2:39', 1, '2018-08-19 10:38:38'),

Sapura Exploration and Production (Sarawak) Inc (Sapura E&P) is the development and production operator with a 40% working interest in the SK408 development. The estimated reserve for Pepulut has not been revealed yet. Even so, pending the signing of a gas sales agreement with Petronas, which underpins project feasibility, any estimate is likely to be categorised as 2C, not 2P at this juncture. Given that this field is in the vicinity of the Gorek, Larak and Bakong fields of phase 1 in the SK408 PSC, which achieved final investment decision in April 2018, we expect this discovery to further enhance the viability of this project cluster by leveraging on the common infrastructure, pipelines and facilities. As the first three fields will be developed as three separate well-head platforms tied back to the existing processing facility and to the Malaysia Liquefied Natural Gas complex in Bintulu, we expect Sapuraâ€™s fabrication yard utilisation to improve significantly towards the end of the year. The group already secured two Hess Exploration and Production Malaysia BV well-head platforms and the Pegaga central processing platform from Mubadala Petroleum. Sapura E&Pâ€™s financial year 2020 (FY20) forecast production is expected to fall by 12% year-on-year from natural decline. However, the Gorek, Larak and Bakong gas fields in the US$200 million phase 1 of the SK408 PSC are targeted to commence production in FY21, radically transforming annual gas output from two million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) by 10 times to 12 million boe and propel overall hydrocarbon production to 13.4 million boe, up 3.8 times from 3.5 million in FY18. The fields under the SK408 gas field development project, which have an estimated reserve of 2.8 trillion cu ft of gas, are part of the discoveries made by Sapura E&P in its 2014 drilling campaign. The SK408 gas fields will be Sapura E&Pâ€™s second major upstream gas development project in Sabah and Sarawak, after the successful development and commencement of production from the groupâ€™s 30%-owned SK310 B15 gas field late last year. With crude oil prices now trading above US$75 (RM300) per barrel, the limelight has returned to Sapuraâ€™s E&P operation, with its proposed listing becoming much more likely, reinvigorating the groupâ€™s overall rerating process.

Due to this, we have maintained our full-year earnings estimates for KPJ and increased our estimates for UEM Edgenta. However, we have revised our financial year 2018 (FY18) to FY19 earnings estimates for IHH Healthcare Bhd and Pharmaniaga Bhd as we opine that meaningful recovery in earnings will only be visible in second half 2018 (2H18). During the quarter, IHH experienced high operating costs associated with opening of new hospitals which disrupted earnings growth whilst KPJ had lower inpatient and outpatient admissions in Indonesia. That said, most healthcare operators reported year-on-year improvement in earnings due to the revision in prices to accommodate inflation effects on operating expenditure (opex) increase in number of complex cases undertaken and increase in contribution from existing and newly opened hospitals. We reiterate our view that we expect earnings of the private healthcare operators to display further improvements from 2H18 onwards. As per 1H18, we are expecting revenue and earnings growth to be mainly driven by organic growth from existing hospitals as well as hospitals that were newly opened back in 2015 to 2017. In addition, we are also expecting the opening of new specialisation wards in recently opened hospitals will contribute positively to the operatorsâ€™ earnings as well. Furthermore, as the contribution from newly opened hospitals grows, it will offset the high opex associated with the opening of the new hospitals. Aside from the organic growth from existing and new hospitals, we are also expecting better revenue in 2H18 as the zero-rated goods and services tax (GST) will encourage inpatient admissions and outpatient visits to private hospitals. Despite the GST being zero-rated for three months pending the reintroduction of sales and services tax (SST), we believe this will nonetheless encourage the patients who have been delaying surgery or treatment to come in and take advantage of the zero-rated GST period due to the increase in disposable income. Furthermore, with the current stable currency situation patients could also take advantage of lower medical consumable costs compared with last year. â€” MIDF Research, June 13', '6/14/2018 2:21', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Upside risk hinges on Tanjung Jati A (Tj Jati A) successfully achieving financial close. We note the Yeoh family has been acquiring shares directly from the market in April 2018 and May 2018. Compilation of exchange filings shows that the Yeoh family had directly acquired about 91 million shares from the market in April 2018 and May 2018, representing on average about 9% of daily volume. This represents a deviation from past practices, where YTL Power International Bhd would conduct share buy-backs and subsequently distribute treasury shares as stock dividends. The inadvertent read-through would be that of a potential privatisation. However, we caution that any potential privatisation would likely be in the form of a share swap (into YTL Corp Bhd shares), not a cash offer. There remains no positive progress over YTL Powerâ€™s 80%-owned greenfield coal plant Tj Jati A in Indonesia. The project has still not achieved financial close, with power purchase agreement terms having already been revised (likely downwards) in March 2018. Based on managementâ€™s original internal rate of return guidance, we estimate the project could have added about 45 sen to our TP. However, the repeated delays to achieving financial close point to significant execution challenges to be overcome. Our earnings forecasts and 85 sen TP are unchanged. Our TP is based on sum-of-parts, with the operating entities each valued by discounted cash flow.

Additionally, associatesâ€™ income will also increase, underpinned by higher demand for the CX-5. Recall that both Mazda Malaysia and Inokom assemble and manufacture units for the export and domestic markets. Â 4QFY18 earnings grew by 41.3% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) and more than 100% y-o-y on the back of better earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) margins (4QFY18: 10.4%; 3QFY18: 9.2%; 4QFY17: 7.8%) due to the stronger ringgit. However, this was partially offset by weaker sales in the Philippines. Â Q-o-q volume growth in Malaysia was driven by the new CX-5 launch, which made up 70% of its sales in 4QFY18. On the other hand, sales volume in the Philippines declined by 33% q-o-q after the increase in excise taxes, as implemented by the government. This resulted in a total sales volume decline of 0.9%. Â BAuto declared a fourth interim dividend of 2.3 sen for 4QFY18 and a special dividend of 2.7 sen. This brings total dividend for FY18 to 10.4 sen (FY17: 11.7sen) and implies total payout of 86% (FY17: 112%). We impute FY18 full-year figures into our earnings model. Thus, earnings are increased by 2.6% and 5% in FY19 and FY20. We also introduce FY21 earnings of RM275.2 million, which implies a 8.4% core net profit growth. We expect earnings in FY19 to be sustained at current levels, with growth underpinned by the new CX-5 and export activities. Following that, the launch of the new CX-8 complete knocked-down (CKD) will drive growth in FY20. Going forward, we expect BAuto to continue paying out generous dividends. This is underpinned by subdued capital expenditure requirements and a large cash pile of around RM300 million. Â We note that the listing of its Philippines division has been shelved at this juncture. This is due to the lacklustre outlook, given the increase of car excise duties in the Philippines. Â After the earnings adjustments, we arrive at a higher TP of RM2.64 (previous: RM2.53) based on unchanged 13 times calendar year 2019 price-earnings ratio. We maintain our â€œbuyâ€ call. The groupâ€™s handsome dividend yield of 5.3% to 7.1% for FY19 to FY21 will cushion any downside risk. â€” TA Securities Research, June 13', '6/14/2018 2:23', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Notably, it has halted its 10-month y-o-y positive growth streak. As such, we believe the current production level has recovered and is back to the pre-El Nino level. Moving forward, we expect production to deliver growth in June. Exports of palm oil decreased 15.7% m-o-m and 14.3% y-o-y to 1.29 million tonnes in May given a nosedive in export to India (-75% m-o-m to 75,269 tonnes). We believe the unfavourable performance was partly due to the high import tax imposed by India. Nevertheless, the negative export growth was mitigated by exports to China (+42% m-o-m to 193,137 tonnes), Pakistan (-1% m-o-m to 128,701 tonnes) and Turkey (+124% m-o-m to 98,026 tonnes), in which these nations were the top three destinations of our exports and comprised 32.5% of our total exports in May. Moving forward, we expect export growth to pick up slightly in view of the low base in May. Â Palm oil closing stock was down 0.5% m-o-m to 2.170 million tonnes but increased 39.4% y-o-y against 1.55 million tonnes in May 2017. Meanwhile, the stock-to-usage ratio rose to 1.87 times from 1.54 times m-o-m, no thanks to the poor exports in May. Looking ahead, we expect inventory to continue trending down, albeit at a slower pace, in view of the pickup in export growth which outweighs production growth. Â We believe the soft CPO price in May was due to lower exports and in line with the weak soybean price in the Chicago Board of Trading. Nevertheless, our 2018 full-year average CPO price forecast remains at RM2,560 per tonne amid bearish factors such as the strong ringgit, high inventory and hike in import duties in India. Overall, we believe the CPO price will continue tracking the inventory level, which is currently trending down. Overall, we maintain our neutral view on the sector as we expect a flattish fresh fruit bunch production growth and softening CPO price amid a hefty inventory. Meanwhile, the long-standing challenge of shortage of labour continues to weigh on performance in the plantation sector, putting pressure on plantersâ€™ operating costs. Â For stocks under our coverage, we retain â€œbuyâ€ calls on Kim Loong Resources (target price [TP]: RM1.52) and Genting Plantations (TP: RM10.82). Our top pick for the sector is Kim Loong Resources given its prudent management, judging from the consistent earnings performance posted by the group for the past few years as well as its generosity in rewarding shareholders. Also, we are sanguine about Genting Plantationsâ€™ prospects as it is able to attain operational efficiency. We maintain â€œholdâ€ calls on Kuala Lumpur Kepong (TP: RM25.67), IOI Corp (TP: RM4.57) and IJM Plantations (TP: RM2.50) due to their rich valuations. â€” JF Apex Securities, June 12', '6/14/2018 2:25', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

However, we deem the results to be in line as first-half performances are generally weaker and we expect a strong performance in the second half of FY19 (2HFY19). 1QFY19 CNP only dipped 4% year-on-year (y-o-y) despite a steep drop in revenue (-23%) as the impact was well cushioned by higher contribution from the associate/joint-venture level, which increased substantially by 479% thanks to the contribution from the light rail transit Line 3 (LRT3). The drop in revenue was driven by both its construction and metering divisions, which we believe could be due to the timing of the billings for its ongoing projects and meter orders. Quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q), 1QFY19 CNP fell 69%, underpinned by lower revenue (-42%), mainly dragged down by its construction division, which saw a 48% decrease in revenue, as they booked in several project completions in 4QFY18. To date, the total construction cost for LRT3 has yet to be finalised by Prasarana. Based on available data and news flow which we have compiled, the construction cost for LRT3 has well exceeded RM9 billion. We are expecting the total cost for LRT3 to hover closer to RM14 billion to RM15 billion, and we believe that the government will continue with the construction works of LRT3, as most of the contracts have already been awarded to various contractors and construction works are already in progress. While we think that LRT3 is likely to proceed, we highlight that there would be significant risk to earnings and valuations on the contrary. Post results, we made no changes to our FY19 and FY20 earnings. We are upgrading George Kent from â€œunderperformâ€ to â€œoutperformâ€ but with a lower sum-of-parts-driven TP of RM2.20 (previously, RM3.65). To recap, we previously called an â€œunderperformâ€ on George Kent due to its rich valuation as it traded up to FY19 price-earnings ratio (PER) of 17.3 times. However, we see value emerging in the stock arising from the recent selldown due to the negative news flow on construction as several mega infrastructure projects have been scrapped since the change in government. Our current TP of RM2.20 is based on: i) 10 times FY19 PER for metering; ii) nine times FY19 PER for construction (lowered from 17 times PER, previously in anticipation of low contract flows going forward); iii) net present value of 6% project delivery partner fees based on RM9 billion cost; and iv) 30% discount to 1QFY19 net cash, implying FY19 PER of 8.8 times. Key downside risks to our call are lower-than-expected margins, delay in construction works, and scrapping of the LRT3 project by the government. â€” Kenanga Research, June 13', '6/14/2018 2:26', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Gas Malaysia announced yesterday that the government had approved the natural gas tariff hike, a 3.3% increase, via a letter from the Energy Commission dated June 12. However, the surcharge of 77 sen/MMBtu under the gas cost pass through mechanism will result in an effective increase to RM32.69/MMBtu, Gas Malaysia said, making it an effective 5.79% increase in the tariff rate. The biannual tariff hike was not unexpected. According to MIDF Research analyst Aaron Tan Wei Min, the current rate, translating roughly into US$8.20/MMBtu, is close to recent global prices of liquefied natural gas (LNG). â€œThere is nothing unusual about the rate hike as they are trying to adjust it to the market price,â€ he told The Edge Financial Daily. Data published by Japanâ€™s ministry of economy, trade and industry show the price of spot LNG imported into Japan declined to US$8.2/MMBtu in May this year from US$9.1/MMBtu in April. According to the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (Margma), while its members will certainly see some increase in costs, it is likely that they are able to pass these through to customers. â€œAs long as the rate is in resonance with the market and the increase is not astronomical, we will accept and pass through any additional cost,â€ Margma president Denis Low said in response to questions by The Edge Financial Daily. Notably in December last year, the government approved a 22.9% hike in natural gas tariff from RM26.46/MMBtu to RM32.52/MMBtu, a move heavily criticised by energy-intensive industries. â€œMargma applauds the government for its wisdom to minimise the increase to help stabilise our economy in these trying and challenging times. We need to stay competitive,â€ Low said yesterday. Tan said it is likely that larger manufacturers such as glove makers and food and beverage (F&B) manufacturers will be better able to pass on costs, although residential consumers including eateries could feel a slight pinch. â€œTechnically, there should be inflation in prices, but manufacturers and middlemen such as wholesalers may not pass on the price increases,â€ Tan said. As such, it is unclear what the full economic impact of the tariff hike may have on prices in general. â€œThe indirect impact [on prices] may be significant although the weightage of natural gas in the Consumer Price Index is not as high as fuel prices,â€ said an economist who declined to be named. He pointed out for households, an increase in the use of electric stoves, for instance, could soften the impact of the higher natural gas price. Any slowdown in demand from households and small businesses is unlikely to put a significant dent in Gas Malaysiaâ€™s earnings, however, as most of its volume is driven by large manufacturers which typically consume more than they agree to purchase, said Tan. Annuar Rahman, analyst at BIMB Securities Research, told The Edge Financial Daily that while demand from F&B manufacturers could decline slightly, large manufacturers such as glove makers are unlikely to demand lower volumes of natural gas as they have international orders to fulfil. Gas Malaysia said while the tariff revision has no material impact on its business operations, it is expected to contribute positively towards the financial position of the company for financial year ending Dec 31, 2018.

The contingent liability risks will also hinge on the governmentâ€™s treatment of large infrastructure projects that may be placed under review but have benefitted from government-guaranteed loans in the past, said the rating agency. â€œ[Our] assessment of contingent liability risks posed by non-financial sector public institutions has also not changed following some statements by the new government,â€ Moodyâ€™s said in a statement yesterday issued in conjunction with its release of a report entitled â€œGovernment of Malaysia: FAQ on credit implications of the new governmentâ€™s policiesâ€. For 2017, Moodyâ€™s said it is maintaining its estimate of Malaysiaâ€™s direct government debt at 50.8% of gross domestic product (GDP). As for the impact of the new governmentâ€™s removal of the goods and services tax (GST), Moodyâ€™s said: â€œIn the absence of effective compensatory fiscal measures, this development is credit-negative because it increases the governmentâ€™s reliance on oil-related revenue and narrows the tax base.â€ By scrapping the GST, Moodyâ€™s said Putrajaya could lose a revenue to the tune of 1.1% of GDP in 2018 â€” even with some offsets â€” and 1.7% beyond 2018, â€œfurther straining Malaysiaâ€™s fiscal strengthâ€. The Pakatan Harapan government has said the GST would be zero-rated for three-months from June 1. Beginning Sept 1, the GST will be replaced with the sales and services tax at a rate to be announced later. As for the reintroduction of the targeted fuel subsidies, Moodyâ€™s deemed the move as credit-negative as subsidies will distort the market-based pricing mechanisms. In addition, it said the fuel subsidies â€œcould strain both the fiscal position and the balance of payments while raising the exposure of government revenue to oil price movementsâ€. Moodyâ€™s said the change in government will not materially alter growth trends in the near term, but a review of large infrastructure projects could result in any pickup in investment being more spread out than the credit agency had previously anticipated. Moodyâ€™s said it will examine new policies holistically to gauge their impact on the countryâ€™s credit profile. Malaysiaâ€™s fiscal measures, it said, are a particular area of focus, given that the countryâ€™s high debt burden acts as a credit constraint. â€œThe transition of power in Malaysia â€” following elections in May â€” away from the incumbent party that led the country for more than six decades has introduced some policy uncertainty. â€œTo what extent the new government achieves fiscal deficit consolidation will be vital in gauging the eventual effects on Malaysiaâ€™s fiscal metrics and credit profile,â€ said Moodyâ€™s.', '6/14/2018 1:51', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The statement was issued in response to reports quoting PKR de facto leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim that the Battersea Power Station deal and other major â€œdubiousâ€ property investments in the UK will be investigated by the new Malaysian government. On Tuesday, shares in S P Setia and Sime Darby Property took a beating following Anwarâ€™s statements. S P Setia shares fell 25 sen or 7.81% to RM2.95 from RM3.20 a day before, while Sime Darby Propertyâ€™s stock sank eight sen or 6.2% from RM1.29 to RM1.21. Yesterday, their shares rebounded: S P Setia was up five sen or 1.7% to RM3, with a market capitalisation of RM11.63 billion, while Sime Darby Property grew four sen or 3.31% to RM1.25, valuing the group at RM8.5 billion. As for the proposed Â£1.608 billion (RM8.58 billion) divestment of the projectâ€™s commercial assets to the EPF and Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) â€” who together, directly and indirectly, own about 67% of the equity in the power station development â€” the developers said the purchase price is still subject to further due diligence and on the basis that the development is completed and fully tenanted. PNB holds majority stakes in S P Setia and Sime Darby Property, which jointly own 80% of the equity in the Battersea Power Station project. The EPF directly owns the remaining 20% stake in the project. PNB and the EPF signed a heads of terms on Jan 18 this year with Battersea Phase 2 Holding Company Ltd, the joint-venture company tasked with developing the power station, to initiate preliminary negotiations to purchase the commercial assets. â€œAs previously assured by all parties, the decision to explore the potential reorganisation of ownership is purely an investment consideration initiated by the Battersea Power Stationâ€™s board and management team, together with the EPF and PNB,â€ said S P Setia and Sime Darby Property, adding that they are of the view that the transaction will enable them to continue to reallocate capital to other areas of their development businesses. â€œPNB and the EPF view this as a strategic opportunity to secure ownership of a unique and iconic real estate asset, which will be able to deliver sustainable income streams into the future to meet their respective income needs,â€ they added. They said the transaction is expected to generate an attractive long-term yield for investors, and the transaction has been extended to June 29, 2018. â€œThe parties are continuing to work positively and constructively together towards completing the proposed transaction and a further announcement will be made in due course,â€ they added. The two property developers also provided updates such as work on the power station building itself is progressing well, and that it is scheduled to open to the public in late 2020, with some 40 million people expected to visit the power station annually when it opens. The power station building will house 120 shops and restaurants, an event space and visitor attractions, as well as 253 residential apartments, which are currently 90% sold. Its approximately 1.8 million sq ft of space will include 500,000 sq ft of offices which have been pre-let to Apple Inc, they said, adding that it is one of Londonâ€™s largest-ever office pre-lets. Moreover, they said the developmentâ€™s scheduled late-2020 opening will also benefit from the 3km extension of the Northern Line underground rail to a new Zone 1 station at the power station. â€œThis Â£1 billion investment by Transport for London will support the rejuvenation of the entire Nine Elms area, including the recently opened US embassy and a further 20,000 new homes,â€ they said. The site acquisition and subsequent costs of the power station development have been fully funded by a combination of equity from shareholders, together with development debt provided on commercial terms by a mixed group of nine Malaysian and international lenders â€” of which more than 60% have been provided by international lenders, they said. â€œThe Â£458 million development loan for Phase 1 has been fully repaid ahead of schedule.

By the time this article is published, the USâ€™ Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may have decided on a 25 basis points (bps) rate hike. The outcomes of the ECB and Bank of Japan (BoJ) meeting are also expected to be known by this week. â€œOn the European front, ECB officials have hinted that the committee will discuss its exit plan from its QE programme during the upcoming meeting on Thursday (today). The ECB has embarked on normalising its easing programme since January 2018, reducing its monthly bond purchasing rate from â‚¬60 billion (RM282.26 billion) to â‚¬30 billion. â€œGiven evidence of economic recovery in the eurozone despite recent disappointment in data, it is inevitable that some of these easing measures have to be unwound. Besides that, the ECB is also faced with some constraints on the amount of bonds they are able to buy,â€ Maggie Wong, senior portfolio manager at Affin Hwang Asset Management told The Edge Financial Daily via email.She noted that yields for German bunds have been driven lower amid recent political uncertainty across the eurozone, as well as multiple data surprises on the downside. â€œAny indication of QE taper will result in higher German bund yields, which mayÂ spill over to other rate markets as well. ButÂ the central bank has previously guided for rates to stay unchanged â€œwell pastâ€ the programmeâ€™s conclusion, and any future moves will likely be more gradual and incremental in nature,â€ Wong said. Similarly, UOB Malaysia economist Julia Goh saidÂ the ECB is likely to discuss the tapering of its bond purchases. â€œGenerally, we will see some emerging market (EM) risk aversion and domestic policy uncertainty to weigh on the ringgit. Hence, we should be seeing the US dollar/ringgit inching higher,â€ Goh said. The ringgit against the US dollar is flirting with the 4.0 level, which has not been breached since Jan 10 this year. At the time of writing, it was traded at 3.9938 against the US dollar. Ray Choy, the head of treasury and markets research at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd, said initially, the expectation was for the ECB to end asset purchase in the third quarter this year, although the political situation in Italy as well as fears of the domino effect across the European Union may hamper this plan. If the ECB turns more dovish due to recent Italian developments or other reasons, this may support EMs since this reduces the worries of a synchronisation of tighter monetary policy on a global scale,â€ Choy said. However, Jameel Ahmad, the global head of currency strategy and market research at FXTM,Â said EM currency fluctuations remain heavily reliant on the momentum of the US dollar, thus the US interest rate decision will likely have a greater impact on the ringgit than the outcomes of both the ECB and BoJ meetings. â€œThe ECB and BoJ will still be seen as important event risks of course,â€ he said. On the FOMC, Wong said the market has priced in a 25bps rate hike, which will bring the US benchmark rate to a new range of 1.75% to 2%. â€œThe focal point this time around will be on the Fedâ€™s (US Federal Reserve) gross domestic product (GDP) and inflation projections, whereby a higher forecast could spell an increased pace of monetary policy tightening,â€ she added. While the Fed had guided for three hikes for 2018 during the FOMC meeting in March, analysts would look out for the Fedâ€™s dot plot projection and whether they will raise the Fed funds rate forecast by 25bps as well as projections for 2019 and 2020, Wong said. â€œGiven rising inflation on the back of higher energy prices, [the] market has now priced in a 40% probability of an additional hike in December 2018 (four hikes in total). We expect to see some upside pressure on yields on a hawkish outcome,â€ she noted. CIMBâ€™s Choy also said the market expects three to four rate hikes in 2018 and the trend is for the monetary tightening in the US to continue into 2019. â€œA common concern is for rate hikes to be damaging to the EM currencies, including the ringgit, although markets will vacillate between rate hikes and growth concerns caused by ongoing trade tensions between the US and the rest of the world. Nonetheless, the communications of these rate hikes were well in advance, which should not surprise investors, hence the impact could be muted,â€ he added. As for portfolio positioning, Wong maintained a defensive stance and will hold on to higher cash levels for the interim. â€œAs we head into theÂ US Fed and ECB policy meetings this week, we will refrain from lengthening our portfolio duration at least until more clarity is seen,â€ she said. Choy, on the other hand, expected the bond market to have priced in the rate hikes beforehand, and that the reaction by markets in EMs and Malaysia is likely to be minor. He noted that the US is already at the mature stage of the rate hike cycle. As for Japan, Choy noted that the monetary policy will continue to be accommodative as its economy remains weak and inflation targets are being missed. â€œAs such, Japanese money is likely to seek better returns overseas given low interest rates at home and this may mean a greater impetus for funds to flow from Japan to Malaysia and other high growth economies,â€ he added.', '6/14/2018 1:37', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

This is in line with the national rationalisation plan and Gas Cost Pass-through (GCPT) announced in December 2016.Â In addition, under the GCPT framework, a surcharge of 77 sen per mmbtu will apply to all tariff categories due to higher actual gas costs against the reference gas costs, translating to an average effective tariff of RM32.69/mmbtu which is slightly higher than RM32.52/mmbtu for 1H18. â€œThe higher effective tariff rate will have neutral impact to Gas Malaysiaâ€™s bottom-line as it is a cost pass-through from higher gas costs.

During his 40 years working in emerging markets, Mark Mobius has gained a reputation for being optimistic more often than not on their prospects. He recently sounded less upbeat and his views arenâ€™t positive on the biggest stock exchange in the Middle East. The kingdom is expected to earn emerging-market status from index compiler MSCI Inc. next week, three years after it opened its equity markets directly to foreigners. â€œWe are not necessarily bullish on Saudi stocks, simply because the range of offerings is limited and a number of restrictions are still in place,â€ said Mobius, 81, who recently set up Mobius Capital Partners LLP after three decades at Franklin Templeton Investments. â€œMany difficulties remain for Saudi market entry.â€ Before Saudi Arabia invited foreigners to trade directly on its bourse, it was viewed among the most restricted markets in the world. Attracting investors has been part of the governmentâ€™s broader economic plan to reduce reliance on income from oil. But foreign ownership of stocks remains low and the value of trading on the bourse is weaker than before it was opened to outsiders on June 15, 2015. MSCI is due to announce on June 20 whether it will add the country to its emerging markets category, a move that would follow a similar decision by FTSE Russell in March. The index compiler has more over $1.9 trillion tied to its EM indexes, and even though the upgrade could lead to billions of dollars in inflows to Saudi Arabia, it wonâ€™t â€œnecessarily be a game changerâ€ as such, but rather â€œone more step towards openingâ€ the market, Mobius said in an emailed response to questions. Three Years of Changes Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is spearheading efforts to modernize Saudi society, and that includes turning the kingdomâ€™s $523 billion stock market into a gateway for foreign investment. Foreign ownership is currently about 5 percent under the broadest measure, a fraction of the level in established emerging markets such as Brazil, where itâ€™s 50 percent, and Turkey, at almost 65 percent. Efforts have included reducing the minimum asset threshold required from institutional investors to $500 million from initial $5 billion, as well as aligning trade settlement times on the Tadawul, as the exchange is known, with international standards and made trading rules easier for fund managers by allowing them to aggregate orders. Mobius believes the $500 million requirement is still high, as it â€œeliminates many investors and restricts the potential liquidity of the market.â€ A restriction on foreigners to hold no more than 49 percent of a companyâ€™s listed securities is a further brake on investment. Saudi stock market reforms were largely aimed at fulfilling the requirements of index compilers such as MSCI and FTSE Russell. The Tadawul All Share Index has risen 14 percent in 2018 amid bets those changes will lead to status upgrades, with foreign inflows to stocks positive almost every week this year. Princes Detained Those purchases have come despite the sudden reminder of regional risks late last year, when princes and dozens of officials were detained for about three months in a luxury hotel in Riyadh, in what Saudi authorities called a crackdown on corruption. The purge unnerved investors, and some still cite a lack of transparency and doubts over corporate governance as reasons to stay away. â€œOf course, there is considerable political risk in the region and that is something that we always must assess,â€ Mobius said. Not even the prospect of Saudi Arabia hosting a world-record initial public offering entices the emerging-markets veteran. An IPO for state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco, originally planned for the second half of this year, is now likely in 2019, the kingdomâ€™s oil minister said last month. Saudi Arabia hope to sell 5 percent of the worldâ€™s largest oil exporter, valuing the company at more than $2 trillion. â€œThe Aramco IPO has corporate governance problems,â€ Mobius said. â€œSince it is an instrument vital to the Saudi budget, the question always will be if the interests of minority shareholders will be subsumed under the dictates of the Saudi government.â€ - Bloomberg', '6/13/2018 22:38', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

But investors put a steep initial estimate on the cost of the deal: at least $2.7 billion. ZTE agreed to pay at least $1 billion in penalties and overhaul its leadership to escape essentially a death sentence. That still leaves it with the challenge of replacing its entire senior management and board just as it tries to rebuild trust with phone companies and corporate customers. Its shares plunged 42 percent in Hong Kong and the 10 percent daily limit in Shenzhen, wiping out $2.7 billion of market value as trading resumed after a two-month hiatus. If the fall in Shenzhen eventually matches Hong Kongâ€™s Wednesday slide, the value lost could reach $7.7 billion, though mainland investors typically follow their own logic. The Shenzhen-based company didnâ€™t explain how it would recruit new managers or who would lead the business following the departures of executives like Chairman Yin Yimin and President Zhao Xianming. Typically, those decisions would be handled by the board -- but that group is also in flux. That leadership tumult comes as telecom operators around the world prepare to pick suppliers and spend billions on blazing-fast fifth-generation wireless technology. ZTE had struggled against far larger rival Huawei Technologies Co. even before Washington laid bare serious holes in its internal culture, accusing ZTE of covering up violations of Iranian-export sanctions for a year or more. Thatâ€™s unlikely to win it much credibility as gear-makers bid for expensive 5G network contracts and distrust of Chinese corporates grows from Australia to the U.S. Meanwhile, thereâ€™s no guarantee American lawmakers wonâ€™t come back with further sanctions. â€œThe biggest challenge is that internally, they have to reorganize,â€ said Edison Lee, an analyst at Jefferies. â€œItâ€™s going to be a tough period of adjustment.â€ Read more on ZTEâ€™s share collapse The U.S. blocked ZTEâ€™s ability to buy from U.S. suppliers in April, saying the company violated a 2017 sanctions settlement related to trading with Iran and North Korea and then lied about it. That choked off supply of the chips and other components from American names such as Qualcomm Inc. that it needs to make networking gear and smartphones, forcing the company to grind to a halt just weeks later. The Shenzhen-based company is likely to incur losses of at least $3 billion as a result of the U.S. action. ZTE became one focal point in a trade dispute between China and the U.S. An agreement that allowed the company to reopen was seen as a key Chinese demand as the worldâ€™s two largest economies try to avoid a trade war that could undermine global growth. After a plea from Chinese President Xi Jinping to help the company get back into business, President Donald Trump said the action against ZTE would lead to â€œtoo many jobs in China lost.â€ How ZTE Ended Up in Middle of U.S.-China Trade War: QuickTake But forces in Washington are lining up against the president. The U.S. Senate has advanced legislation to restore penalties on ZTE, voting 91-4 to begin debate on the National Defense Authorization Act, which included an amendment that will keep restrictions on ZTE. Senators of both parties are also looking at an appropriations bill as a possible vehicle to block the Trump administrationâ€™s deal. Itâ€™s unclear whether Congress would be able to drum up enough support to reinstate a ban on the Chinese company. Beyond deliberations on Capitol Hill, ZTE may have already lost valuable ground not just to Huawei but also global rivals such as Ericsson AB and Nokia OYJ. â€œThe international expansion, right now, they have a lot of challenges. So the outlook of the company is just less optimistic than before,â€ Lee said. Severing ZTEâ€™s Head Leaves the U.S. Battling a Hydra: Tim Culpan ZTE has some ground to make up even at home. Itâ€™s endured withering criticism from both state-run media and consumers on social media for its lackadaisical approach to governance. In a commentary, China National Radio warned Chinese firms shouldnâ€™t be like â€˜giant babiesâ€™ and rely on Beijing to bail them out when they run afoul of international laws. In its filing, ZTE detailed steps it will take to shake things up internally. The settlement calls for replacing the entire boards of both parent ZTE and subsidiary ZTE Kangxun within 30 days of the order, as well as terminating all members of senior leadership at both. It will also submit nine audit reports of its compliance with U.S. export control laws. And it plans to assess the full impact of the April U.S. export denial order and update its financial reports. â€œItâ€™s now the worldâ€™s fourth largest telecom equipment maker but it still needs to grow its footprint in 5G,â€ said Xiang Ligang, a telecoms consultant and chairman of industry website cctime.com. â€œThe ban dealt a heavy blow to ZTE as a company but its intellectual property pool has been growing and is getting stronger.â€ - Bloomberg', '6/14/2018 0:17', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

But they also signalled a desire to re-engage with regional government leaders in search of solutions to the worsening homelessness crisis.Â The announcement of the proposed repeal comes two weeks after King County\'s annual homeless count revealed a 4% increase, with a steep rise in people living in their vehicles.Â Some service providers, who were anticipating a surge in city homelessness funding from the head tax, lamented the aggressive campaign against the tax.Â â€œThe onus is very much on those who fought so hard against this solution to identify a better one, or admit they\'re OK with the city having shanty towns and favelas in our public spaces indefinitely,â€ said Lisa Daugaard, a member of a city task force whose recommendations formed the basis for the head-tax proposal.Â Others decried the council\'s lack of political will.Â â€œIf this is not the solution, then what? We do need to do more than just talk about it. It does need to be addressed,â€ said Patricia Hayden, co-chair of the Seattle Human Services Coalition and chief program officer for the YWCA of Seattle.Â Marilyn Strickland, president and chief executive of the Metropolitan Seattle Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber is â€œready to work on solutions â€“ from employment, to technological innovation, to housingâ€. However, the chamber declined to participate in the revenue task force whose findings led to the head tax.Â Denise Moriguchi, chief executive of longtime Seattle grocery company Uwajimaya, has emphasised that the tax would affect not just technology giants like Amazon â€“ the rhetorical target of head tax supporters â€“ but also family-owned grocers and other businesses.Â Her company, which contributed to the repeal initiative campaign, would be subject to the tax, which would apply in 2019 to businesses with US$20mil (RM79.88mil) in annual revenue in the city of Seattle.Â She said Monday she appreciates the council\'s responsiveness to concerns of businesses and Seattleites who spoke out against what she called â€œreckless spendingâ€ and an â€œill-conceived proposal to tax the very businesses which provide jobs, generate tax revenue and provide support to organisations that help address homelessness.Â â€œI strongly believe that there is a better way forward, one that improves current spending efficiency and effectiveness all while encouraging economic growth and job creation,â€ she added.Â Amazon, also a contributor to the initiative campaign, did not respond to a request for comment.Â The head tax negotiated by Mayor Jenny Durkan and passed unanimously by the council last month was lowered to an amount that Durkan hoped would appease Amazon. The company never expressed public support, but it restarted a building project it had paused after the head tax passed.Â Even without a head tax, Seattle\'s business taxes are substantially higher than those of most other Washington cities. The trade-off includes the amenities of a major city and the talented workforce available here.Â But for low-margin grocery and retail businesses in Seattle, which employ many entry-level workers and have competitors in lower-tax jurisdictions nearby, the accumulation of taxes and regulations in recent years is becoming a significant burden. They cite the US$15 (RM60)-an-hour minimum wage and soda tax, among others.Â â€œYou can\'t just pass every cost that the city creates on to your consumer when your consumer has other options,â€ said Terry Halverson, chairman of Metropolitan Market, which has four of its seven locations in Seattle and would be subject to the head tax. His concerns about previous taxes and regulations fell on deaf ears at City Hall, he said.Â Halverson said he\'s hopeful that the head tax turnabout is a sign that the council is becoming more responsive to businesses. He likewise hopes businesses will become more engaged in the homelessness issue. Metropolitan Market, he said, wants to join the mayor\'s One Table task force, a joint effort between cities and King County that was partly created to find an alternative to taxing Seattle\'s businesses.Â The One Table effort stalled during the head-tax debate and another meeting of the group isn\'t even scheduled. But it stands as the only regional approach to homelessness in play.Â In any case, homeless advocates say more funding is needed to address the crisis.Â Daugaard, with the revenue task force, was less hopeful because the head tax was crushed without an alternative plan in place.Â â€œIn the fury over the employee hours tax, opponents have cast everything into the fire,â€ Daugaard said. â€œAnyone who wants to see public homelessness reduced or ended is going to pay for that â€“ and that includes them.â€ â€” The Seattle Times/Tribune News Service', '6/14/2018 0:30', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

At US$35 a share, the bid represents a 19 per cent premium over the Disney offer, the company said yesterday. And itâ€™s cash, rather the the stock Disney is proposing.The move follows AT&T Incâ€™s victory over the US Justice Department in its antitrust battle to take over Time Warner Inc. That outcome is expected to spur a wave of media consolidation, emboldening companies to make offers they might otherwise have skipped.Disney and Comcast are locked in a high-stakes contest for the Fox entertainment assets, which include movie and TV studios, television networks such as FX, and multichannel providers like Star India and Sky Plc. With yesterdayâ€™s bid, Comcast Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts is seeking to disrupt Disney CEO Bob Igerâ€™s plan to use Fox properties to bolster that companyâ€™s already-vast entertainment offerings.Comcast first approached Fox last year with an informal proposal. Comcast bid 16 per cent more than Disney for Foxâ€™s media properties, but that offer was deemed too risky. The AT&T decision has lifted some of those clouds.Breakup feeMurdoch, 87, also wasnâ€™t swayed by Comcastâ€™s overtures because the cable company didnâ€™t offer a breakup fee. Comcast said last month that its new offer would be at least as favourable to Fox shareholders as Disneyâ€™s terms. Indeed, the proposal unveiled yesterday include a US$2.5 billion termination fee â€” similar to what Disney has offered.â€œWe are pleased to present a new, all-cash proposal that fully addresses the boardâ€™s stated concerns with our prior proposal,â€ Roberts, 58, said in a letter to Rupert Murdoch and his sons, Lachlan and James, who also serve as Fox executives.â€œWe are also highly confident that our proposed transaction will obtain all necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner and that our transaction is as or more likely to receive regulatory approval than the Disney transaction.â€Netflix threatDisney made a US$52.4 billion all-stock bid for Fox, which was accepted in December. Comcastâ€™s official counterproposal now pressures Disney to come up with a higher offer for Fox â€” lest it have compelling entertainment assets slip through its hands at a time when technology giants are storming Hollywood, forcing traditional media companies to bulk up.In recent weeks, Philadelphia-based Comcast confirmed its desire to outbid Disney in advance of shareholder votes set for July 10. The cable provider planned to approach Fox investors and has told the Justice Department of its interest, an early step in addressing potential antitrust concerns, according to a person familiar with the matter.Comcast already owns film and TV studios, broadcast and cable TV operations including the NBC and USA networks, and the Universal Studios theme parks.Streaming ambitionsBoth Disney and Comcast could use Foxâ€™s TV and movie properties to stream more content directly to consumers and compete with Netflix Inc. The companies also are interested in expanding internationally at a time when the US television business is slowing.When a federal judge rejected the Justice Departmentâ€™s suit against the Time Warner deal, it was seen as an endorsement of so-called vertical mergers â€” combinations that include both media distribution and the programming itself.Comcast also is making an ambitious push in Europe that centres on UK pay TV provider Sky. After Fox made a takeover offer for the 61 per cent stake in Sky that it doesnâ€™t already own, Comcast launched a Â£22 billion (RM117.4 billion) counterbid for the business. Disney also is interested in owning Sky.But Comcast investors havenâ€™t welcomed the companyâ€™s sudden appetite for megadeals. Its shares were down 19 per cent this year through Wednesday. If Comcast buys Fox and Sky, the cable giant could become one of Americaâ€™s largest corporate borrowers and its credit ratings may teeter at the bottom edge of investment grade.Comcastâ€™s board has already unanimously approved the Fox proposal, and no investor vote will be needed. To further sweeten the deal, Comcast plans to reimburse the US$1.5 billion fee that it would have to pay Disney to break up that deal.Roberts, the CEO, said he expects the Justice Department to review his proposed takeover plan at the same speed as Disneyâ€™s deal. And because Comcast has less of a presence outside the US, the company expects it can get international clearance easily.â€œThere should not be any meaningful difference in the timing of the US antitrust review between a Comcast and Disney transaction,â€ he said. â€œWe expect to work together to reach an agreement over the next several days.â€ â€” Bloomberg', '6/14/2018 0:05', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Estimated US gasoline demand hit a record high of 9.9 million barrels per day (bpd) in the week, the data showed.â€œThe demand metrics here are amazing for crude oil and gasoline,â€ said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital in New York. â€œPut the exports of crude on top of that, and it\'s just a really bullish report.â€US crude production rose to 10.9 million bpd last week, according to the EIA, but Kilduff said the market appeared able to absorb the increase. â€œIt seems like we need almost every barrel of that to keep up with this refining demand.â€With output in Russia rising back above 11 million bpd in June and Saudi production climbing to more than 10 million bpd, supplies from all three top producers are increasing.The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-Opec producers, including Russia, started pumping less in 2017 to reduce a global crude glut.

Unemployment and inflation are low ... The overall outlook for growth remains favourable.â€He added that continued steady rate increases would nurture the expansion, as the Fed approaches a sort of sweet spot with its employment and inflation goals largely met, the economy withstanding higher borrowing costs and no sign of a spike in inflation.The ongoing economic expansion coupled with solid job growth has pushed the Fed to raise rates seven times since late 2015, rendering the language of its previous policy statements outdated.Policymakers\' fresh economic projections, also issued yesterday, indicated a slightly faster pace of rate increases in the coming months, with two additional hikes expected by the end of this year, compared to one previously.They see another three rate increases next year, a pace unchanged from their projections in March.â€œThe Fed\'s path of gradual rate hikes and slow (balance) sheet reduction seems well established at this point. The trajectory of US inflation or the broader US economy would likely need to change materially for the FOMC to deviate from that path,â€ said Aaron Anderson, senior vice president of research at Fisher Investments.US Treasury yields rose after the Fed\'s decision while US stocks were trading marginally lower and closed down on the day. The US dollar pared some losses but was still trading lower against a basket of currencies.Powell also announced the central bank would start holding news conferences after every policy meeting next year, which means a total of eight in 2019. The Fed chief currently holds four such events each year.Fed confidenceFed policymakers projected gross domestic product would grow 2.8 per cent this year, slightly higher than previously forecast, and dip to 2.4 per cent next year, while inflation is seen hitting 2.1 per cent this year and remaining there through 2020.That\'s a welcome change from recent years when Fed policymakers fretted about an inflation rate well below target.The unemployment rate, currently at an 18-year low of 3.8 per cent, is expected to fall to 3.6 per cent this year, compared to the 3.8 per cent that the Fed projected in March.â€œThe labour market has continued to strengthen ... economic activity has been rising at a solid rate,â€ the Fed said in its statement. â€œHousehold spending has picked up while business fixed investment has continued to grow strongly.â€The Fed\'s short-term policy rate, a benchmark for a host of other borrowing costs, is now roughly equal to the rate of inflation, a breakthrough of sorts in the central bank\'s battle in recent years to return monetary policy to a normal footing.Though rates are now roughly positive on an inflation-adjusted basis, the Fed still described its monetary policy as â€œaccommodative,â€ with gradual rate increases likely warranted as the economy enters a 10th straight year of growth.Estimates of longer-run interest rates were unchanged and seen reaching as high as 3.4 per cent in 2020 before dropping to 2.9 per cent in the longer run.Trade tensionsThe latest rate increase was in line with investors\' expectations ahead of the release of the policy statement. Investors had given just over a 91 per cent chance of a rate rise on Wednesday, according to an analysis by CME Group.The Fed said its policy of further gradual rate increases will be â€œconsistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labour market conditions, and inflation near the Committee\'s symmetric 2 per cent objective.â€In a technical move, the central bank also decided to set the interest rate it pays banks on excess reserves â€” its chief tool for moderating short-term interest rates â€” at just below the upper level of its target range. The step was needed, the Fed said, to be sure rates stay within the intended boundaries.The policy statement bypassed discussion about the tensions over the Trump administration\'s trade policies, including a decision two weeks ago to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico.Individual Fed policymakers have expressed concerns about the economic risks of a broad tit-for-tat tariff retaliation, but have said they would not change their policies or forecasts until those risks are realised. â€” Reuters', '6/13/2018 22:36', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Key producers, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, have reaffirmed the deal since then.But Matt Smith, director of research at ClipperData, said Trump himself is responsible for some of the pressure due to the decision to exit the Iran deal.â€œItâ€™s confusing why the president would come out with a statement like this now,â€ Smith said. â€œThe real catalyst for the recent rise in prices is the sanctions on Iran.â€While the world turns its eyes on the Vienna Opec meeting, oil market watchers are also monitoring activity in Trumpâ€™s home market, where higher prices are feeding more production of American shale oil.US production of oil came in at 10.9 million barrels per day last week, according to data released today by the US Energy Information Administration, up nearly 17 per cent from the year-ago level.Opec itself spotlighted US output in its own monthly report yesterday, citing the growth of non-Opec supply as one of several question marks hanging over the situation.Various sources show that â€œconsiderable uncertainty as to world oil demand and non-Opec supply prevails,â€ Opec said, leading to a wide range of estimates for the remainder of 2018. â€” AFP', '6/13/2018 15:31', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Sorrell â€” who has already launched a new venture â€” has denied any wrongdoing, and the chairman said there was nothing more he could say on the issue.â€œI know that questions remain, but there is simply nothing further we can legally disclose,â€ Quarta said at the start of a meeting that lasted little more than an hour.New heartTrying to refocus the meeting on the future of the business, Quarta told investors that the hunt for a new chief executive was well advanced and moving ahead rapidly.As well as anger about Sorrell, investors also had questions about the groupâ€™s strategy after performance disappointed in 2017, when it delivered its worst annual sales performance since the financial crisis.The two chief operating officers currently running WPP, Mark Read and Andrew Scott, are reviewing its strategy, and Read, seen as the leading candidate to replace Sorrell, said he was confident about the future.â€œI think the business can succeed without him (Sorrell),â€ Read said.â€œPeople inside the company have every confidence that we can do that. We need to find a new beating heart for the group,â€ he told investors.Trading improvesWPP is the worldâ€™s largest ad group, employing more than 200,000 staff in agencies including JWT, Ogilvy and Finsbury to serve clients such as Ford, Vodafone and P&G.The group has recently been hit by the might of Google and Facebook in online advertising, the advance of consultants like Accenture in the sector and by pressures on big ad spenders such as P&G and Unilever which have all hit the bottom line.But in a trading update published to coincide with the annual meeting, WPP reported four-month net sales which were marginally up, an improvement on the 0.1 per cent fall in net sales in the first quarter.Liberum analysts said the improvement should give investors confidence that the company can meet its guidance for flat sales and margins this year.â€œThe statement today should reassure that this is more than achievable especially as WPP is expecting a pick-up in the second half and the comparisons, particularly in North America, get easier,â€ they said in a note.WPP shares were little changed at Â£12.45 at 1310 GMT, having gained an initial boost from the update.Mixed viewsQuarta defended the companyâ€™s response to the allegation against Sorrell, saying it was robust from a governance and legal perspective.While he accepted criticism from investors over future share awards due to Sorrell, he noted that these pre-dated the current boardâ€™s involvement.It is not the first time investors have expressed opposition to WPPâ€™s pay proposals. Sorrell has earned around Â£200 million (approx RM1.07 billion) in the last five years alone, and in 2016, a third of WPPâ€™s investors refused to back his Â£70 million pay package.Sorrellâ€™s last award scheme could potentially pay out Â£20 million, but it is expected to come in well below that due to the recent underperformance of the group.Nearly every question asked at the meeting, which was packed with shareholders, was about Sorrell and his departure, and not everyone was critical.One investor asked why the chairman hadnâ€™t started by leading a tribute to a man who had built the company from scratch. â€” Reuters', '6/13/2018 14:36', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

They cautioned that no final decision has been made and the company could end up weathering a downturn and keeping the business.A spokesperson for Siemens said the company doesnâ€™t comment on market speculation. It also doesnâ€™t break out earnings for the turbine activity, which is part of the power and gas unit that accounted for 15 per cent of Siemensâ€™s â‚¬20.1 billion (approx RM94.5 billion) in total sales last quarter.Siemens shares rose 1.3 per cent to â‚¬117.36 at 1.19pm in Frankfurt, giving a market value of â‚¬99.9 billion.The deliberations come after Siemens unveiled a plan in November to cut 6,900 jobs at the power and gas division and close some factories. The unit has suffered from a collapse in turbine orders as the global energy industry shifts to renewable sources like wind, solar and hydropower. Finding a buyer may not be easy as competitors face similar issues.General Electric Co, a market leader alongside Siemens, is mired in a deep slump largely because of a deterioration in its own power-generation business. The Boston-based company recently announced 12,000 layoffs in the unit and said the market for gas turbines will remain â€œsoftâ€ for several years.

On the question on which of the new governmentâ€™s policies will affect the sovereignâ€™s credit quality, Moodyâ€™s said it will examine the policies holistically to gauge their impact on the credit profile, as in Malaysiaâ€™s case, fiscal measures are a particular area of focus, given that the countryâ€™s high debt burden acts as a credit constraint. â€œConsequently, to what extent the new government achieves fiscal deficit consolidation will be vital in gauging the eventual effects on Malaysiaâ€™s fiscal metrics and credit profile.â€ Noting that the change in the government will not materially alter growth trends in the near term, Moodyâ€™s said the scrapping of the Goods and Services Tax, in the absence of effective compensatory fiscal measures, is credit negative because this increases the governmentâ€™s reliance on oil-related revenue and narrows the tax base, although this will boost private consumption in the short term. It projected that revenue lost from the scrapped tax would measure around 1.1% of GDP this year albeit some offsets and it is expected to expand to 1.7% beyond 2018, further straining Malaysiaâ€™s fiscal strength. â€œMoodyâ€™s views the targeted reintroduction of fuel subsidies as credit negative because subsidies distort market-based pricing mechanisms, and could strain both the fiscal position and the balance of payments while raising the exposure of government revenue to oil price movements.â€', '6/13/2018 4:33', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The company is considering selling about 10% of the company, the minimum required under Hong Kong exchange rules, to avoid dilution, said one of the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is private. Meituan is targeting a valuation of roughly US$60 billion, the person said, although the valuation and fundraising target wonâ€™t be in the initial filing documents. With the first filing in June, the actual listing of Meituan shares is likely around October, the people said. Meituan is also considered a prime candidate to sell shares in mainland China as part of the governmentâ€™s program to give more opportunities to domestic investors. Itâ€™s not clear yet when the sale of Chinese depository receipts would take place. Meituan declined to comment on a potential IPO and said that if it has specific fundraising plans it will announce them at the appropriate time. The IPO is another sign of Chinaâ€™s rising might in the technology industry, which has become a flashpoint for trade tensions with the U.S. A generation of up-and-comers like Meituan are emerging to build out an industry that has been dominated by Tencent Holdings Ltd, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Baidu Inc. Smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp is said to plan raising about US$10 billion by selling shares in Hong Kong and mainland China. â€œTheyâ€™ve expanded to the point where they have successfully created an ecosystem,â€ said Mark Natkin, managing director of Beijing-based Marbridge Consulting. â€œThey need to get a lot more capital to further strengthen that.â€ Meituan was most recently valued at US$30 billion, making it the worldâ€™s fourth most valuable startup, according to CB Insights. It is sort of a mash-up of Groupon, Yelp and Deliveroo with restaurant reviews, group-buying discounts and deliveries of food, groceries and other goods. It has more recently expanded into areas such as ride-sharing and travel. With a few taps to navigate its smartphone apps, Chinese customers can order up hot meals, groceries, massages, haircuts and manicures at home or in the office. Chief Executive Officer Wang Xing founded Meituan.com in 2010 as a group-buying site similar to Groupon Inc before a 2015 merger with Dianping, which provided reviews of restaurants and other local businesses. The combined company handled US$57 billion of transactions last year between about 320 million active buyers â€” about the size of the American population â€” and more than four million merchants. The company however faces formidable rivals in key businesses. Itâ€™s competing with entities backed by Alibaba in food delivery, with Didi Chuxing in ride hailing, and even with its own backer Tencent in payments. It also expanded into bike sharing with a deal for Mobike said to be valued at US$3.4 billion. An IPO would give Meituan additional capital to compete in existing businesses and even to expand. No final decisions have been made, and details of the offering could change, the people said. â€œMeituan has been expanding its business from offline stores selling fresh products to online cab hailing, and also purchased Mobike earlier this year,â€ said Yang Xin, a researcher at Analysys International. â€œThey are in need of a large amount of capital to support all those businesses.â€ Didi, the ride hailing leader, has also been considering an IPO. Meituanâ€™s rapid push to go public may suck up some of the capital that would otherwise be allocated to Didi. Meituanâ€™s other existing backers include Booking Holdings Inc, Sequoia Capital, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Trustbridge Partners, Tiger Global Management, Coatue Management and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC. Those investors and more have handed Meituan US$7.3 billion in funding over the past two years. Itâ€™s now also begun promoting the use of its own digital wallet on its app: it handles about a fifth of overall transactions on its platforms.

Its net profit for the quarter ended March 31 (1QFY2018) fell 68.31% year on year to RM4.1 million as revenue slipped nearly 27% to RM121.24 million. Note that the bottom-line figure includes RM3.88 million booked as other income plus RM3.52 million recorded as fair value gain on biological assets. Adjusted for the latter, the companyâ€™s profit falls further to about RM580,000. Its borrowings are proving to be a major drag on TH Plantationsâ€™ margins. As at March 31, its gearing ratio stood at 0.7 times. The strain of servicing its debt nearly wiped out the companyâ€™s operating cash flow in 1QFY2018 amid lower revenue, its cash flow statement shows. Long-term borrowings constitute the bulk of the companyâ€™s debt at RM1.19 billion. It has another RM45.24 million in short-term borrowings. Despite a 14% growth in the planterâ€™s output of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) â€” its fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year increase â€” poor CPO prices led to operating cash flow falling 80.84% year on year to RM10.65 million in 1QFY2018. At the same time, it paid RM14.11 million in finance costs for the quarter. Capital expenditure and loan repayments, among others, saw TH Plantations get through RM34.54 million cash in 1QFY2018. As at March 31, its cash and cash equivalents stood at RM64.7 million. During the quarter, TH Plantations clocked in a CPO average selling price (ASP) of RM2,355 per tonne, according to Maybank Research, versus an all-in production cost of RM2,248 per tonne. With a high cost base, the companyâ€™s margins could remain under pressure in the near term as CPO prices have weakened further to date. Malaysian Palm Oil Board data shows that CPO prices averaged RM2,418 per tonne in April, the lowest monthly average so far this year. While the data for May average prices is not final yet, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that it could dip below the April average. When contacted, a company official points out that operationally, TH Plantations is doing fine as FFB production is rising. â€œBut CPO prices have been quite weak recently and thatâ€™s tough for plantation companies, especially for us as we are a pure upstream player,â€ says the executive who declined to be identified. The 14% uptick in FFB production during the quarter is encouraging as 1Q is historically the companyâ€™s weakest quarter in respect of output. Further output growth could benefit TH Plantations if CPO prices improve going forward. Leading vegetable oils analyst Dorab Mistry reportedly forecast CPO prices to range between RM2,500 and RM2,700 this year. However, production growth is a double-edged sword as any ASP deterioration will hurt TH Plantationsâ€™ bottom line. Â Degearing hitches Weaker CPO prices are hitting the companyâ€™s margins amid a debt rationalisation exercise that involves the disposal of non-core assets in order to raise cash and repay debt. In an interview a year ago, managing director Datuk Seri Zainal Azwar Zainal Aminuddin had told The Edge that the company had earmarked four non-core assets to be sold by 2019. At the time, the target was to reduce gearing to 0.5 times from 0.72 times then by selling two of the non-core assets by end-2017. A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that to achieve the targeted reduction, borrowings would have to be slashed by RM400 million. However, the plan seems to have run into trouble as the company did not announce any asset sales in 2017, likely due to the difficulty in finding ready buyers for vast tracts of plantation land. TH Plantationsâ€™ last asset disposal was in 2016 when it sold THP Gemas Sdn Bhd for a one-off gain of RM112.58 million. In theory, TH Plantations could turn to its shareholders for cash to pare down its borrowings, for example via a rights issue. However, the hurdle to such a proposal is tight liquidity as pilgrims fund Lembaga Tabung Haji owns 73.8% of the planter while the Employees Provident Fund holds about 6.9%. In December 2017, TH Plantationsâ€™ board gave its approval to sell the companyâ€™s investment in Ladang Jati Keningau Sdn Bhd, which carries a net book value of RM30.08 million based on its latest annual report. The lease on the 1,550ha estate expires in 2078. â€œEfforts to sell the asset have commenced, and a sale is expected to be completed within 12 months of the approval date,â€ TH Plantations says in its 1QFY2018 release. The company owns 101,000ha across Malaysia and Kalimantan, Indonesia, of which 60,350ha are planted with oil palm. It also has six palm oil mills with a combined capacity of 240 tonnes per hour.

A majority of 31 economists said the PBOC will increase by five basis points the rate it charges on reverse-repurchase agreements, which guide funding costs in financial markets, after the Fedâ€™s expected tightening. That decision is due to be announced around 2:00 a.m. Beijing time on Thursday, with a potential PBOC step coming as early as that day. Meanwhile, a similar share of economists said the PBOC will further lower reserve-requirement ratios in the second half of this year, the survey showed. Such a move would release liquidity into the financial system, helping lenders meet a string of repayment obligations in the coming months. The prospect of the central bank tightening with one hand and loosening with the other shows the multiple targets that the PBOC is currently trying to reach: It wants to ensure enough funding to the real economy to manage a nascent slowdown, keep up the pressure on banks to curb leverage, and maintain a steady interest-rate differential with the U.S. The central bank is facing a â€œtrade-offâ€ during deleveraging and it has to adjust policies constantly as the situation changes, said Xia Le, chief Asia economist at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA in Hong Kong. â€œIt has to ease slightly when companies feel the squeeze, and raise borrowing costs again if the financial sector resumes adding leverage.â€ He said the overall policy is moving to â€œneutral and even to a slightly easing biasâ€ from the previously tight stance. In Lockstep Investors anticipate the Federal Reserve will increase its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point to a range of 1.75 percent to 2.0 percent when it meets Wednesday. Moving in step with the U.S. prevents the yuan from weakening further against a strong dollar, and it keeps the spread between Chinaâ€™s 10-year government bonds and Treasuries in a comfortable range -- fending off capital repatriation and supporting foreign investorsâ€™ demand for domestic Chinese bonds. Not hiking would be a strong signal of an easing stance, according to Xia. Speculation about just such a stance grew recently when authorities cut reserve ratios and adjusted the collateral rules for the central bankâ€™s medium-term funding tool. More than one third of the economists in the survey said the PBOCâ€™s monetary policy stance isnâ€™t clear, despite the official â€œprudent and neutralâ€ orientation. â€Higher rates are needed to alleviate potential depreciation pressure on the yuanâ€ while ample liquidity is necessary to avoid a funding squeeze, said Amy Zhuang, senior analyst for Asia at Nordea Markets. As the bank lending rate for individuals and businesses rises and bond defaults increase under the deleveraging campaign, authorities are tweaking the debt containment strategy to â€œset differential requirementsâ€ for different sectors, according to a statement released after an April meeting presided over by President Xi Jinping. In May the PBOC changed a policy target to â€œrestructuringâ€ from â€œdeleveraging,â€ in a report in which it reviewed and previewed its policy stance. Credit data in May suggest the deleveraging efforts may have already taken a toll on the economy. The sagging data may â€œdrive policy changes in the next couple of monthsâ€, Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura International Ltd in Hong Kong. â€What the central bank is doing now is structural easing,â€ as it could be raising interest rates while keeping liquidity loose with RRR cuts and loans through the Medium-term Lending Facility, said Ming Ming, head of fixed-income research at Citic Securities Co. in Beijing. The twin aims arenâ€™t conflicting - they complement each other, and they come in sequence, the former PBOC official said. â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter if the PBOC raises interest rates or not this time -- the easing stance of monetary policy in terms of the quantity of funds will not change,â€ he said. â€œInstead, more attention should be given to RRR cuts and MLF operations in the future as they have greater influence over the money market and the interest rate curve.â€ - Bloomberg', '6/13/2018 8:04', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The agency expects demand to grow at the same rate this year, unchanged from its last report in May.â€œA solid economic background and an assumption of more stable prices are key factors. Risks include possibly higher prices and trade disruptions. Some governments are considering measures to ease price pressures on consumers,â€ the Paris-based agency said in its monthly report.â€œThere is the possibility of a downward revision to our economic assumptions in the next few months. The world economy is feeling some pain from higher oil prices.â€The oil price has risen by a third to around US$76 a barrel, close to its highest since late 2014, since Opec and other producers including Russia began cutting production in January 2017 by 1.8 million bpd.â€œIncreasing trade tensions are the main risk to our oil demand forecast,â€ the IEA said.Canada and the European Union have announced plans to increase tariffs on selected US goods in response to US duties on steel and aluminium imports.â€œThe risks associated with escalating retaliations are not negligible ... A prolonged slowdown in trade would negatively affect world GDP growth and oil demand, as a significant part of oil consumption is linked to trade activities.â€Opec decision aheadThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on June 22/23 to discuss its supply policy, particularly in light of protracted declines in Venezuela and the prospect of new US sanctions on Iran later this year.The group, together with its partners, may consider raising output to compensate for any supply shortfalls.â€œEven if the Iran/Venezuela supply gap is plugged, the market will be finely balanced next year, and vulnerable to prices rising higher in the event of further disruption. It is possible that the very small number of countries with spare capacity beyond what can be activated quickly will have to go the extra mile,â€ the agency said.â€œIf the other 12 Opec members were to continue pumping at the same rate as May, a potential supply gap could emerge and lead to a draw on stocks of more than 1.6 million bpd in the fourth quarter of 2019,â€ the report said.The agency said it had looked at a scenario in which by the end of next year output from Iran and Venezuela could be 1.5 million bpd lower than it is today.The IEA estimated that Iranian exports would drop by the same amount as they did during the last round of sanctions.For Venezuela, the agency said it saw no respite in the collapse in production from economic crisis that has taken 1 million bpd off the market in the past two years.Opecâ€™s efforts in restraining output led to commercial oil stocks across the worldâ€™s richest nations falling by 3.1 million barrels in April to a new three-year low of 2.809 billion barrels, the agency said.Supply from outside Opec is expected to grow by 2 million bpd this year, led predominantly by the United States, before easing to around 1.7 million bpd next year, the IEA said.â€œRecently this expansion has not been without stress. The discount for WTI (US crude) versus Brent has blown out to US$10 a barrel, amidst signs that takeaway capacity is lagging behind output growth,â€ the IEA said.â€œTo make up for ... losses (from Iran and Venezuela), we estimate that Middle East Opec countries could increase production in fairly short order by about 1.1 million bpd and there could be more output from Russia on top of the increase already built into our 2019 non-Opec supply numbers.â€The IEA estimated demand for Opecâ€™s crude would ease in 2019 to 31.6 million bpd from a forecast 31.9 million bpd this year. â€” Reuters', '6/13/2018 8:57', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The likes of Unisem (M) Bhd, Globetronics Technology Bhd, Inari Amertron Bhd and Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd (MPI), as well as ViTrox Corp Bhd, Elsoft Research Bhd, Aemulus Holdings Bhd and MMS Ventures Bhd climbed at least 50% to as much as 290% in 2017. Joining the tech stock rally, JF Technology Bhd and FoundPac Group Bhd, which design and manufacture high-performance test sockets and other materials for semiconductor giants, also saw their share prices gain 410% and 6% respectively last year. Notably, with the ringgit strengthening against the US dollar in the first quarter, these export-oriented semiconductor and semiconductor-related firms have seen a weaker share price performance so far this year. For instance, Unisem, MPI and Globetronics have seen their share prices decline 37%, 22% and 16% respectively year to date. Most, however, have rebounded or recovered slightly in recent weeks against the backdrop of a stronger US dollar since April, except for JF Technology and FoundPac, whose stock prices have halved since the start of the year. Is this a good time for investors to buy into JF Technology and FoundPac, or at least put them on the bottom-fishing watch list? JF Technology managing director and CEO Datuk Foong Wei Kuong tells The Edge that, despite a stronger ringgit in the first quarter of the year, the group is still showing growth, albeit marginally. In the nine months ended March 31 (9MFY2018), JF Technologyâ€™s revenue grew 5% year on year to RM18.9 million, while net profit increased 3% y-o-y to RM4.33 million. While Foong concedes that JF Technologyâ€™s share price is in correction territory, he is of the view that most shareholders are keeping their shares, considering the low volume traded. He attibutes the dip in share price to global sentiment. â€œJudging from our current performance, in spite of the challenging global scenario, we are still showing growth,â€ he says. Foong adds that JF Technologyâ€™s exposure to the automotive sector is sizeable, and with the high adoption of integrated circuit (IC) devices in this sector, the company should be able to weather the challenges. FoundPac CEO Lee Chun Wah says the companyâ€™s shares â€œmay be undervaluedâ€, but he notes that the fall in share price is entirely sentiment driven. â€œWe believe that with our strong fundamentals, the real value of the company will emerge in the share price in the long run,â€ he tells The Edge. Despite higher revenue, FoundPac saw its net profit drop 21% to RM5.87 million y-o-y in 9MFY2018. Lee says the impact of the stronger ringgit has already been felt in the first quarter this year. For 9MFY2018, total realised and unrealised foreign exchange loss came to RM627,000, compared to a forex gain of RM654,000 a year ago. Â Closest peers, but not direct competitors Penang-based FoundPac produces stiffeners and high-performance test sockets used by multinational semiconductor corporations, including fabless semiconductor firms, printed circuit board (PCB) design houses as well as companies in the outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) industry. As for JF Technology, the homegrown high-performance test contacting solutions provider manufactures and supplies test probes and test socket products for the semiconductor industry worldwide. JF Technology is headquartered in Kota Damansara, Selangor, and its integrated facility is capable of producing 1,200 test sockets per month. Its customers include Unisem, Aemulus, Carsem (M) Sdn Bhd and SRM Integration (M) Sdn Bhd. In the semiconductor testing process, OSAT companies need equipment to test integrated circuits (IC). For the tester to â€œcommunicateâ€ with the IC, an interface comprising a PCB or test board is required. But for the test board to dock inside the tester, a mechanical fixture â€” a stiffener â€” is needed to align the test board to the tester. Meanwhile, for the test board to â€œcommunicateâ€ with the IC, a test socket is needed to hold the IC. Despite the similarities in business activities, JF Technologyâ€™s historical price-earnings ratio (PER) of 20 times is significantly higher than FoundPacâ€™s 12 times. In fact, at their peak last year, JF Technology was trading at a PER of more than 50 times, compared with FoundPacâ€™s 28 times. JF Technologyâ€™s Foong points out that the company and FoundPac are in different niche segments of test socket applications and the two companies very rarely cross paths. â€œI would say FoundPac is not our competitor. We are not similar even though we are in the (same value chain). Application requirements divide us,â€ he says, adding that JF Technology is competing with US-based Johnstech International and Japan-based Rika Denshi Co Ltd in the test contacting market. Meanwhile,Â Lee says JF Technology is considered FoundPacâ€™s closest competitor as both companies have a common product â€” test sockets. But that does not mean the two are direct competitors. â€œAs far as we know, we are using different technologies in producing test sockets. So far, we have not competed directly in exploring new market segments and securing new customers,â€ he says. It has not gone unnoticed that JF Technology and FoundPac have strong net cash positions. As at March 31, JF Technology was sitting on a RM9 million cash pile while FoundPac had a war chest of RM37.5 million. So, do they plan to declare more dividends to reward shareholders? â€œYes, we would like to reward our shareholders with higher dividends when the signs are clear. We are mindful of the pending lawsuit,â€ says Foong. To recap, Johnstech International filed a patent infringement lawsuit against JF Technology in June 2014, involving JF Techâ€™s test socket product called Zigma. Over the past 12 months, FoundPacâ€™s dividend yield of 3.3% was higher than JF Technologyâ€™s, which offered only 1.7%. FoundPacâ€™s Lee says the company has adopted a dividend policy of distributing at least 30% of its annual audited net profit to shareholders. â€œHowever, the dividend distribution also depends on various factors such as the cash flow requirements for operations and capital expenditure, the availability of adequate distribution reserves and our financial performance,â€ he says. JF Technology and FoundPac had comparable profit margins at about 25% to 30% in FY2017.

Meanwhile, Lee expects a challenging year ahead in FY2018, but hopes that results will improve in FY2019. â€œThe global electronic and semiconductor industry is expected continue to grow next year.

Home prices in Hainan, known for its resort-lined beaches, recorded Chinaâ€™s second-fastest monthly price increase in April, spurred by Beijingâ€™s commitment to promote the island province as a tourism hub and free trade zone. But new measures in April restricting non-residents from buying homes on the island, where non-locals normally comprise about 80 percent of purchases, have caused sales to plunge. Home transactions in Hainan in terms of area fell 14 percent in May compared with April, and were down 41 percent from a year ago, according to the real estate research firm CRIC. Official home price data for May is due to be released on Friday. The slide comes as the State Council maps out plans to transform Hainan into Chinaâ€™s largest free trade zone and upgrade its core industries to include not only tourism, but also modern services and high technology. China has been imposing controls across the country to rein in rocketing property prices, often fueled by speculators. The tough new measures in Hainan came after prices jumped by more than 50 percent in some developments after Beijing announced the creation of the free trade zone in mid-April. â€œA free trade zone provides good prospects to the long-term economy so our clients are very positive about it,â€ said Andy Lee, chief executive with Centaline South China, a realtor. â€œThe irony is, even though they are positive they canâ€™t buy any properties.â€ Property agents in the resort island are now packing their bags as they seek greener pastures in other provinces. Li Xuelong, a Hainan property agent, said a number of colleagues had left the island in the past month, while many clients had canceled purchases after authorities introduced what they described as Chinaâ€™s â€œmost stringent tightening measuresâ€. â€œMany of my colleagues have moved to Guangxi and Yunnan to look for business opportunities,â€ Li said, referring to two provinces nearby that are also popular with tourists. With a series of fresh cooling measures announced since late March, Hainan has effectively restricted non-residents from buying homes in a property market that has been highly dependent on tourism and foreign buyers. Other measures include forbidding home owners to sell properties within five years of purchase. The tropical island had attracted many buyers looking for holiday homes or property for speculation. Buyers came mainly from northern inland areas, where temperatures can fall below 30 degrees Celsius in winter. The cooling property market could have a ripple effect on tourism projects in the resort province, industry watchers said. â€œMany developers entered Hainan to sell to outsiders,â€ said Centalineâ€™s Lee. â€œMany of them are engaged in tourism property, so the tourism business is for facilitating the property business. Now with the main business going under water, the tourism projects may have to be suspended.â€ The central government hopes Hainan will reduce its reliance on real estate, but Lee said the transformation could take a big toll on local government coffers, which derive more than 50 percent of their income from real estate, before the free trade zone positively impacts the local economy. Developers said there was nothing they could do but wait for the cooling measures to be lifted, although many said they intended to stop buying land in Hainan. Michael Lee, finance director at Guangzhou R&F Properties, said the company did not have plans to adjust its Hainan sales strategy in response to the policy changes. An executive of another developer, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media, said the company planned to hold on to its remaining unsold apartments, in hopes their value would increase after a few years. â€œWe will look for more land bank in third- and fourth-tier cities where thereâ€™s less tightening,â€ the executive said. â€œThe countryâ€™s policies kept changing so we had to adjust ourselves.â€ In late April, local media reported that some developers had allowed buyers to get around Hainanâ€™s home purchase restrictions by using rental contracts or forward-dating agreements to buy apartments. â€œBut this is risky both for developers and buyers, because regulations can change again at any time,â€ said Li, the property agent.', '6/13/2018 7:58', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Not according to the import data: Russell', 'LAUNCESTON, Australia (June 13): There may be a slight problem with the prevailing theme for the iron ore market this year, namely that China is increasingly interested in using higher-grade ore as part of efforts to boost output and lower per unit pollution. While Chinese steel mills may well be seeking to boost the use of high-grade iron ore fines and pellets, this isn\'t exactly showing up in the import numbers. The overall figure for Chinese iron ore imports is one of stability, with customs data released on June 8 showing 447.5 million tonnes arriving in the first five months of the year, up a scant 0.7% from the same period last year. The breakdown of the data is somewhat trickier, given that the Chinese government hasn\'t released the detailed country-by-country numbers for April, and hasn\'t provided a reason for withholding the numbers. However, vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts, which has a strong correlation with the official numbers, indicates that China is still taking large quantities of medium- and low-grade iron ore. In the first five months of the year 289.3 million tonnes of Australian iron ore arrived at Chinese ports, according to the data. The vast majority of Australian ore is 62%Â iron content, such as that mined by top producer Rio Tinto, or the lower 58%, as produced by the country\'s third-ranked miner Fortescue Metals Group. Very little of Australia\'s output is the high-grade 65% iron ore fines, or high-grade pellets. But Australia appears to have increased its share of China\'s seaborne iron ore imports so far this year, with the vessel-tracking data showing a 4.9 percent gain from the first five months of 2017. Brazil, which is the main supplier of higher-grade iron ore, hasn\'t been able to increase its share of China\'s seaborne iron ore market, according to the shipping data. China imported 83.1 million tonnes from Brazil in the first five months of the year, down fractionally from the 83.5 million for the same period in 2017. The Brazilian situation is somewhat complicated by the distribution centre run in Malaysia by Vale, but the shipping data doesn\'t show any major spike from the Southeast Asian nation, with China\'s imports rising 800,000 tonnes to 8.9 million in the January-May period. One high-grade iron ore producer that has seen a significant increase of its shipments to China, at least in percentage terms, is Peru. China\'s imports in the first five months jumped 19.4%. However, this is off a small base and China\'s imports from the South American producer totalled only 8 million tonnes in the first five months of 2018. Another producer of high-grade iron ore is South Africa, which is the third-biggest supplier to China. However, China\'s imports from South Africa were largely steady in the first five months of the year at 15.4 million tonnes, down from 15.7 million in the same period last year. High-grade tightness? It\'s likely that while China\'s steel mills are wanting to use higher-grade iron ore, the problem is in sourcing additional supplies. Much of the new iron ore brought to market in recent years has been of medium or low quality. This has resulted in the price for higher grade ore outperforming in recent months, with Argus Media assessing 65% ore in China at US$88.55 a tonne on Tuesday, a premium of US$22.90 a tonne to the 62% grade. This means the price of higher-grade ore is currently 35% above the medium-grade, which is a substantial widening from the 19% premium that prevailed at the end of last year. The discount for low-grade ore with 58% iron content to medium-grade has also widened, going from 27% at the end of 2016 to 45% by the end of 2017. Currently, it is 42%, according to Metal Bulletin\'s assessment of 62% ore at US$67.23 a tonne on Tuesday and 58% ore at US$39.29. Overall, the current pricing in the market suggests that supplies of higher-grade iron ore remain tight, but low-grade cargoes are still finding buyers, and the discount has settled into a new range.', '6/13/2018 7:35', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

It is a study about the attitudes of banking customers in Malaysia, Australia, Hong Kong, Philippines and Taiwan.The survey reveals that Malaysian bank customers have a strong appetite for technology innovations to enable digital bank services â€“ depending on the type of transaction.Fifty-two per cent of Malaysian consumers are comfortable with their bank using software and algorithms to assess online credit card applications.Vice-president financial services Richard Parker said less consumers are willing to use for â€œlife eventsâ€ such as home loan applications which involve larger financial amounts and emotional involvement.Forty per cent of Malaysians meanwhile support their bank sharing their personal data with other companies to access financial products â€” the second highest support in Asia Pacific.However, 38 per cent do not support it, citing concerns about privacy and security. Malaysia recorded the highest level of desire to keep personal information private.Parker added for Open Banking to take off in Asia, banks must address customer concerns about how they protect customer data â€” not just in the bank but across all of the departments, partners and agencies in the value chain.Unisys is helping banks to address these concerns with Elevate(TM) â€” an end-to-end, digital banking software platform and suite of applications designed to help financial institutions deliver an instantly secure, omnichannel banking experience to their customers.Via Elevate(TM), customers will be able to pay their bills on the go, transfer funds and apply for loans and mortgages anytime, anywhere â€“ regardless on a mobile device or tablet.Research firm, OmniPoll conducted the online survey in November 2017, polling nationally representative samples of at least 1,000 people aged above 18 years in each country.For more information click here. â€” Bernama https://www.unisys.com/insights/research#UBI', '6/13/2018 7:09', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

In the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, Ta Annâ€™s cash and cash equivalents fell from RM272.86 million to RM179.85 million, equivalent to 37.2% of its current liabilities. The 0.37 cash ratio is the companyâ€™s lowest on a quarterly basis since 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its cash and cash equivalents had fallen on a q-o-q basis in four of the last five quarters. Ta Annâ€™s cash balance was last seen below RM200 million at end-2012. In contrast, its total current liabilities amounted to RM483.82 million as at March 31, of which RM355.55 million were short-term borrowings. According to Ta Annâ€™s 1QFY2018 financial statement, its operating cash flow was hit by a double whammy â€” its timber division remained loss-making for the third consecutive quarter and plantation earnings dropped 78% y-o-y. The plantation segment, in particular, was hit by a combination of low fresh fruit bunches (FFB) output due to weather changes and low average selling prices (ASPs) for crude palm oil (CPO). In the quarter, the companyâ€™s net profit fell 88.4% y-o-y to RM4.23 million as revenue fell 29.7% to RM214.86 million. It declared a 5 sen interim dividend payable on June 29.Notably, net cash generated from operating activities fell 92.2% y-o-y to RM4.17 million. In the same quarter, Ta Ann also completed the acquisition of the 30.4% stake in SPLB for RM170.97 million cash to emerge as the single largest shareholder. It was a related-party deal as the stake was sold by Cermat Ceria Sdn Bhd, a company controlled by Ta Annâ€™s executive chairman, Datuk Amar Abdul Hamed Sepawi. Note that Abdul Hamed is also SPLBâ€™s executive chairman. In the quarter ended March 31, Ta Ann recorded a RM170.97 million cash payment to acquire SPLB and it also raised RM85.38 million in new borrowings to fund the acquisition. To recap, when Ta Ann announced the proposed acquisition on Jan 11, it said that the deal fits into its expansion plans in Sarawak as it would provide access to SPLBâ€™s future production. However, some analysts noted that the investment would take a while to yield returns due to SPLBâ€™s underperforming estates while added finance costs to acquire the stake could offset the extra income recognition. SPLB has a land bank of 48,086ha in Sarawak, 34,837ha (72.45%) of which are planted. Its palm oil age profile is relatively young with 50% prime mature and 41% immature and young mature. It owns and operates two palm oil mills with a total operating capacity of 150 tonnes per hour. Â Cash flow pressure If the operating cash flow weakness in the first quarter persists, Ta Annâ€™s cash reserves could dwindle further given its short-term liabilities, among others. That said, a company official who declined to be named says conditions have been improving in the second quarter thus far and the company expects to play catch-up throughout the rest of the year. â€œIt rained heavily in end-January and throughout February ... almost everyone in the industry in Sarawak is facing the same problems â€” weather issues, rising cost of production and so on,â€ the official says. To be fair, the RM170.97 million cash acquisition and the RM85.38 million financing raised are one-off occurrences. However, its free cash flow â€” a measure of available cash net of capital expenditure requirements â€” was in negative territory in 1QFY2018 for the first time since 2012, according to Bloomberg data. According to its cash flow statement, in 1QFY2018, Ta Ann spent RM6.37 million on plantation development and RM7.21 million to acquire property, plant and equipment. The company also paid a combined RM9.08 million in financing-related payments and dividends to non-controlling interests. Ta Annâ€™s 1QFY2018 earnings surprised analysts on the downside, with its core net profit only making up 4% of full-year consensus estimates, Kenanga Research said on May 25. Its main earnings driver, the plantation business, was hit by wet weather that exacerbated a typically weak quarter while its timber segment remained a drag on earnings. The plantation segment was â€œweighed down by (lower sales volumes of) CPO (-13% y-o-y) and FFB (-11% y-o-y) due to wet weather in Sarawak that led to higher production costâ€, says Kenanga Research. â€œThis was further dampened by weakened CPO prices at RM2,383 per metric tonne (-19% y-o-y).â€ The companyâ€™s ASP could remain under pressure in 2QFY2018 as CPO prices for April and May have been trending downwards compared with the first three months of the year, according to data from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. The plantation segment accounted for over 64% of total turnover and nearly all net profit in FY2017. The segment recorded a RM9.59 million pre-tax profit in 1QFY2018, down 78.3% y-o-y as revenue slipped 28%. Following the results announcement, MIDF Amanah Investment Bank downgraded Ta Ann to a â€œsellâ€. Affin Hwang Capital downgraded the stock to â€œholdâ€, cutting its target price from RM4.25 to RM2.82. The other seven research houses tracking the stock maintained their calls. At the time of writing, there were three â€œbuyâ€ ratings, five â€œholdâ€ and one â€œsellâ€. Â â€˜Cash flow to improveâ€™ Last Thursday, Ta Ann closed at RM2.80 per share, down approximately 23.5% year to date. In comparison, analyst target prices range from RM2.35 to RM3.60 with a consensus target price of RM2.99. In an email response to The Edge, Affin Hwang said its steep target price cut reflects a lower earnings forecast. It also applied a 30% discount to Ta Ann compared with similar mid-sized planters. â€œWe believe the environment will continue to be challenging for the timber side. Hence, we downgrade Ta Ann to a â€˜holdâ€™ rating,â€ Affin Hwang said. In 1QFY2018, Ta Annâ€™s timber segment posted a pre-tax loss of RM7.17 million compared with a quarterly pre-tax profit of RM13 million the year before. Maybank Research noted on May 25 that this is the segmentâ€™s third consecutive sequential loss since the Sarawak government slashed the export log quota from 30% to 20% on July 1, 2017. Effective from the same date, hill timber charges were raised from 80 sen to RM50 per cubic metre, the first revision in three decades. For the full year, Affin Hwang expects the timber segment to remain in the red due to higher production costs and lower log output. â€œFor it to break even (or turn profitable), we believe plywood prices need to be higher significantly to offset the decline in sales volume,â€ Affin Hwang tells The Edge.

And if they come down that\'s okay,â€ Lowe said in Melbourne, responding to a question after a speech titled â€œProductivity, Wages and Prosperity.â€â€œHouse prices in Sydney and Melbourne are still 40 per cent up from where they were in 2014. You\'ve got to have a longer-term perspective here.â€The two cities comprise about 60 per cent of Australia\'s housing market by value and 40 per cent by number of homes.â€œThe thing that gives me some comfort is the fact that lending standards have been strengthened a lot over recent years,â€ Lowe added.Policymakers have long worried about a debt-fuelled binge in the property market that led prices to unsustainably high levels and took the country\'s household debt to income ratio to a record high 190 per cent.Indeed, the RBA is paying close attention to household finances and consumption growth which has remained soft even as the country entered its 27th year of recession-free growth last quarter.That debt pile coupled with a snail-paced rise in wages has squeezed consumer spending, in-turn weighing on inflation.Core inflation, a closely watched measure, has undershot the RBA\'s target for more than two years now.But the RBA is reluctant to ease rates further as it fears that would only push property prices higher.The central bank last cut rates to 1.50 per cent in August 2016, making the current stretch of stable policy the longest on record.â€œAt this stage, a sustained pick-up in inflation to around the midpoint of the target range is likely to require faster wages growth than we are currently experiencing,â€ Lowe said in his speech.â€œThis increase is likely to be only gradual,â€ he added.â€œGiven this, there is not a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy.â€Lowe was still confident of a gradual pick-up in wage increases from the current 2 per cent as more jobs are added and with some companies citing constraints in finding suitable workers.â€œIf this continues to be the case, it is likely that the next move in interest rates will be up, not down,â€ Lowe said. â€” Reuters', '6/13/2018 6:04', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

Speculation about such a move makes the rounds every few years. Listing Petronas, it is said, could be one way to help cut down the countryâ€™s debt, which has breached the RM1 trillion mark, or a little more than 80% of gross domestic product. But will it take place? â€œIt was first mooted some 10 years or so ago by merchant bankers when the government was looking to attract foreigners to invest in Malaysia â€¦ it was the same time Synergy Drive (which later morphed into Sime Darby Bhd around 2007) was created. It involved the merger of Kumpulan Guthrie, Golden Hope and Sime Darby. A plantation giant was created but did it achieve what it was supposed to do? Did foreign investors come flocking in?â€ asks a director of an oil and gas company. â€œSime Darby has since been separated into three diverse units â€” plantations, auto and property â€” but the overall success of the venture is questionable.â€ He adds that the government has not looked at a possible listing of Petronas thus far, largely because that could adversely impact the dividends from it, as well as other payments. â€œImagine shareholders objecting to Petronasâ€™ dividend payments. Can the government stomach that?â€ asks a former analyst. Last year, Petronas paid RM17.4 billion in taxes and RM16 billion in dividends to the government. And that is set to increase with oil prices hitting a 3Â½-year high of more thanÂ US$80 recently. There are also certain national obligations Petronas has undertaken over the years that may not be viewed favourably by the investing community. For instance, in mid-December 2003, Petronas acquired 301.48 million shares or just over a 9% stake in Tenaga Nasional Bhd. In its announcement to Bursa Malaysia, it merely said the â€œacquisition of shares (was) pursuant to the agreement with Ministry of Financeâ€. Petronas ceased to be a substantial shareholder of Tenaga in end-July 2005. Market talk had it then that the government required funds. Similarly, in mid-March 2002, Petronas emerged as a substantial shareholder in Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd, which has since been renamed Proton Holdings Bhd, after acquiring 149.52 million shares, or a 27.2% stake, from Hicom Holdings Bhd, forking out more than RM1 billion. The list of companies Petronas has lent a helping hand is long and includes Bank Bumiputra in the mid 1980s. In the mid-1990s, it acquired 40% shareholding of Putrajaya Holdings, the master developer of the federal capital of Putrajaya, which was built at a cost of more than RM20 billion. â€œWhen you look at all these transactions, it is doubtful if Petronas could have undertaken such acquisitions if it were a publicly traded company,â€ says the oil and gas company director. There had been much elation about a potential listing of Petronas in view of the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco slated for next year. Saudi Arabia hopes to raise US$100 billion by selling a 5% stake in the company, valuing it at more than US$2 trillion. According to an independent external audit, Saudi Aramco has proven oil reserves of at least 270 billion barrels and gas reserves of 298.7 trillion standard cu ft. Its total hydrocarbon production is 13.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). In contrast, Petronas, a Fortune 500 company, produced 2.46 million boe/d, and its entitlement was 1.73 million boe/d as at the first quarter of 2018, ended March 31. For 1Q, Petronas chalked up an after-tax profit of RM11.9 billion (excluding net impairment on assets) from RM57.9 billion in revenue. â€œThere is a question as to how long the oil revenue can last. If there is uncertainty, it will not be viewed positively,â€ says an industry observer. A potential listing may raise as much as RM600 billion to RM800 billion, depending on the valuation and taking into account that Petronas made a net profit of RM46.6 billion in 2017, according to news reports. Disposing of 25% in the oil company could thus raise RM150 billion to RM200 billion. There are also issues to be resolved with Sabah and Sarawak, which are seeking higher oil royalties of 20%, from 5% at present. Sarawak has gone one step further by forming its own oil and gas company, Petroliam Sarawak Bhd (Petros). It has also questioned the Petroliam Development Act 1974, which created Petronas. Petros is understood to have spoken to all oil and gas operators and asked them to negotiate with it in the future and not Petronas. According to the Energy Commission, as at end-2015, Sarawak had 28.7% of all of Malaysiaâ€™s oil reserves and accounted for 29.4% of national production. It also had 52.7% of the countryâ€™s known gas reserves. â€œThere is limited oil and gas in Peninsular Malaysia, so, against this backdrop, a listing of Petronas doesnâ€™t look likely to happen,â€ says the oil and gas company director. In 2010, OSK Research Sdn Bhd (now part of RHB Research) had written about Petronas listing its wholly owned unit Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd and its 90% unit Malaysia LNG Sdn Bhd. It was decided that interference in Petronas Carigali was not acceptable to the government. Petronas opted to float Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, raising RM12.8 billion, and Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd, which brought in about RM1 billion. However, some companies under the Petronas banner that could be listed to raise funds include wholly owned Petronas Lubricant International Sdn Bhd, which manufactures and distributes lubricant products. There is also South Africa-based Engen Ltd, which focuses on the downstream refined petroleum products market and related businesses. While a flotation of both companies could raise billions, Petronas could also pare down its shareholdings in some of its listed entities and raise about RM20 billion. For example, Petronas has a 62.67% stake in MISC. If the oil corporation were to pare down its stake to 51%, it could raise more than RM3 billion based on the current market value. Similarly, Petronas owns 64.35% of Petronas Chemicals, and disposing of a 13.35% stake could raise about RM8.6 billion. Similarly, selling 19% of Petronas Dagangan Bhd, in which Petronas has 70% shareholding, could fetch about RM4.72 billion. The oil company also has a 60.66% stake in Petronas Gas, which has a market capitalisation of RM34.79 billion. Paring its shareholding to 51% could raise RM3.36 billion, based on the current market value. While a flotation of Petronas may be a quick fix,Â it is unlikely to pan out well for the government in the long run.', '6/13/2018 6:00', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

HO CHI MINH CITY, June 13 â€” When Nguyen Duc Tai, the son of a street vendor, said he was going to revolutionise Vietnamâ€™s mobile phone industry, few people gave it a second thought.â€œEverybody laughed at me,â€ says Tai of that time in 2009.But Tai was true to this word. His Mobile World Investment Corp. became the countryâ€™s top seller of mobile phones and one of the biggest listed stocks. The company now has a market value of $1.7 billion.So when Tai said that he was going to overhaul the countryâ€™s food industry, this time people listened.â€œThe future of groceries is very clear,â€ a T-shirted Tai, 49, said in an interview in Ho Chi Minh City. â€œItâ€™s not a question of whether I succeed or not. Itâ€™s a matter of how long it takes.â€Taiâ€™s success as an entrepreneur has come from trying to modernise Vietnam. For mobile phones, he opened what he says was the first high-street chain where customers could have a sense of security about the devicesâ€™ quality and origins. And in the world of food shopping, heâ€™s trying to replace Vietnamâ€™s traditional wet markets with grocery stores.Tai opened his first such outlet in Ho Chi Minh City in 2016, selling vegetables, meat and fish with clearly labeled origins, and other essential items such as noodles and drinks. In wet markets, food is sold outdoors in venues that arenâ€™t always clean. Buyers donâ€™t necessarily know where it comes from, and the prices arenâ€™t fixed.376 storesThe chain â€” called Bachhoaxanh â€” now has 376 stores in the city.â€œOur dream is to take 10 per cent of the US$60 billion (RM239 billion) grocery market by 2022,â€ Tai said. That would be twice his companyâ€™s almost US$3 billion in revenue last year.Of course, Tai has been down a similar road before. Fifteen years ago, a global mobile phone boom had skipped Vietnam, because handsets were too expensive.â€œAt that time, only executives or rich people could buy a cell phone,â€ Tai said. â€œOwning one seemed impossible to many people, and I thought we needed to do something to change that.â€So in 2003, he quit his job as a strategic director at a phone company to start his own business. He opened three stores in small alleys in Ho Chi Minh City, but they failed after a few months because of their locations and inability to win customersâ€™ trust, Tai said.Mobile WorldIn 2004, he tried again, establishing Mobile World with four friends. This time, he opened his stores on major streets and sold devices with transparent origins.Mobile World had 1,065 outlets throughout Vietnam and a 45 per cent share of the countryâ€™s smart-phone and mobile-phone market as of the end of April, it said. At the end of 2017, there were almost 120 million mobile phone contracts in the country, more than the population of about 94 million. Sales of mobile phones have surged with the countryâ€™s economy.â€œOpportunities came very fast and the market developed more quickly than I could imagine,â€ Tai said.Tai grew up poor in Ho Chi Minh City, where his mother was a street vendor who sold sticky rice and rolled rice pancakes. Those early struggles left him with one goal: to have a better life than his parents did.â€œI always wanted to think big and do big,â€ Tai said.Stock surgesMobile Worldâ€™s stock has surged more than sixfold since listing in 2014. Of 10 analysts covering the company, nine say itâ€™s a buy. Mobile World was the only Vietnamese firm on the Forbes list of the best 50 big Asian public companies last year. â€œNow my dream is to have US$10 billion in revenue by 2022,â€ Tai said.For sure, it hasnâ€™t been all smooth sailing. Bachhoaxanh contributed only 3 per cent to Mobile Worldâ€™s sales in the first four months of 2018, with the companyâ€™s leaders acknowledging that the chain is still in the â€œtrial and errorâ€ phase.The grocery business posted negative Ebitda of 60 billion dong (RM10.45 million) in the first quarter, prompting the company to close three outlets and cancel the opening of seven others, local media and brokerages cited Tai as saying at the companyâ€™s analyst meeting in May. The company also reduced its planned new store openings for this year to 500 from 1,000.â€˜Uncertainty stageâ€™â€œBachhoaxanh is still in the uncertainty stage,â€ said Nguyen Duc Hieu, an analyst at Viet Dragon Securities JSC in Ho Chi Minh City. â€œThis is not an easy industry as it requires a good supply chain, which is very hard now because there arenâ€™t enough suppliers big enough to provide fresh meat or vegetables. The market is big, but execution isnâ€™t easy.â€Still, Tai wonâ€™t be too put off by the growing pains. While he had only slightly more than US$30,000 when he started his business, heâ€™s now worth about US$53 million from his shareholding in Mobile World alone, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.And as he gets richer, heâ€™s become less interested in the trappings of wealth, he says. Mekong Capitalâ€™s Chris Freund, an early investor in Mobile World that has since sold its stake, describes him as a â€œvery casualâ€ entrepreneur, noting that on a business trip abroad, Tai and three others shared just one room.But for Tai, the T-shirt isnâ€™t about being frugal. Itâ€™s simply a matter of using his time best as he seeks to build his grocery empire.â€œItâ€™s very tiring thinking about what to wear,â€ Tai said. â€œI would prefer to spend that time thinking about how to develop the company.â€ â€” Bloomberg', '6/13/2018 5:23', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Chinaâ€™s No. 2 telecommunications equipment maker was crippled when a seven-year supplier ban was imposed on the company in April for breaking a 2017 agreement reached after it was caught illegally trading with Iran and North Korea. The ban, which has prevented ZTE from buying the U.S.components it relies on to make smartphones and other devices, will not be lifted until ZTE pays a fine and places $400 million more in an escrow account in a U.S.-approved bank. The Hong Kong-listed shares of ZTE slid as much as 41 percent to HK$14.98, their lowest in a year, following a two-month trading suspension, while its Shenzhen shares fell by their 10 percent limit after it confirmed details of the agreement publicised by the U.S. government on Monday. Hong Kongâ€™s benchmark Hang Seng index was down 0.5 percent in early trade. Confirming details of the deal, ZTE said late on Tuesday it would replace its board of directors and that of its import-export subsidiary ZTE Kangxun within 30 days of the June 8 order being signed by the United States. All members of its leadership at or above the senior vice president level would be removed within the 30-day period, with a commitment that they would not be re-hired, along with any executives or officers tied to the wrongdoing, it said. It also said in filings on Tuesday that it would work to resume operations as soon as possible after the ban gets lifted, and would republish its first-quarter financial results after assessing the impact of the ban and the settlement agreement. The case has become highly politicised and a key focus of bargaining talks as Washington and Beijing look to avert a trade war. U.S. lawmakers have attacked Washingtonâ€™s agreement with ZTE and plan legislation to roll it back, citing intelligence warnings that ZTE poses a national security threat. ZTE, with a market value of around $20 billion before its shares were suspended in April, is the worldâ€™s fourth-largest telecom equipment maker after Huawei Technologies, Ericsson and Nokia. - Reuters', '6/13/2018 4:37', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

IIB had approached the National House Buyers Association (HBA) in 2012 to discuss about a land lease structure in Medini, but the association had rejected it, said HBA secretary-general Chang Kim Loong. The issue then came up again last year when the Department of Lands and Mines under the Natural Resources and Environment Ministry hosted a session in November to brief industry stakeholders. â€œIn November last year, they presented the paper to us. They invited quite a lot of stakeholders; we were not the only ones there but we were the only ones to bring up issues,â€ Chang told SunBiz. The proposals â€” to introduce a new chapter in the National Land Code 1965 and an amendment to the Strata Title Act 1985 â€” had already been drafted by then, SunBiz reported an unnamed lawyer as saying.

As soon as this is passed, freehold land is going to be like gold. They will sell it to our children and grandchildren on leases of 99 years whereas they (developers) become the perpetual owners,â€ said Chang. â€œAfter the lease expires, they can take it back.

In a region vulnerable to volatile price swings, food inflation has been largely contained, thanks in part to favorable weather and increased investment in production, storage and distribution. For developing nations like India and China â€” where food makes up a higher share of spending and consumer price indexes â€” thatâ€™s helped keep a lid on inflation and left them better placed to grapple with the strains caused by US monetary tightening. Less clear is how long the calm will hold. â€œFood price inflation across Asia is subdued, but I donâ€™t think central banks can afford to nod off,â€ said Sumiter Singh Broca, a Bangkok-based official at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and India have already raised interest rates this year in a bid to support weakening currencies amid a sell-off in emerging markets and to get ahead of inflation pressures linked to rising fuel costs. Economists at Citigroup Inc. led by Johanna Chua note that although volatility in Asiaâ€™s food prices has receded, the oil rally and a cyclical bottoming of food inflation should generate higher risks â€” especially for fuel-sensitive economies like Thailand and Indonesia. Oil Risk Food has a weighting in CPI in Asia thatâ€™s more than three to four times larger than fuel and energy, according to Citigroup. Shikha Jha, a Manila-based economist at the Asian Development Bank, warns that rising oil prices will push up fuel and transportation costs in the region. â€œEnergy and food prices are moving together very closely,â€ she said, adding that risks associated with ongoing trade tensions between the US and China also bear watching. Food costs across Asia can vary considerably, both by item and by country, making an overall reading hard to gauge. Globally, prices are already inching higher. The FAOâ€™s Food Price Index averaged 176.2 points in May to hit its highest level since October. The Cereal Price Index was almost 17% higher than a year ago. Sizable purchases by Southeast Asian buyers kept rice prices firm, according to the FAO. Thai rice prices are up more than 7% so far this year and the Philippines has shown strong demand for imported rice. Yet for now at least, the overall picture in Asia is largely benign. â€œWeather has been rather favorable, which means not so much disruption on food supply coming from mother nature, which has traditionally been disruptive for countries such as India, the Philippines, and Vietnam,â€ said Trinh Nguyen, a senior economist for emerging-market Asia at Natixis Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. But unfavorable base effects, higher oil prices, weather risks and weaker currencies mean the cost of imported goods are likely to pick up, she said. In a sign that pressures can quickly rebound, Indiaâ€™s inflation picked up for a second straight month in May to 4.9%, giving ammunition to the central bank to raise interest rates again. Food prices rose 3.1% in May from a year ago, up from 2.8% in April. Indonesia has seen food prices pick up considerably. They climbed 4.5% in May from a year ago, following a 5.2% gain in April â€” the fastest pace since December 2016. In Chinaâ€™s case, food is estimated to make up about 30% of the overall inflation basket and is often whipped by pork. Wholesale pork prices have dropped more than 18% this year due to excessive supply. A consolidation of Chinaâ€™s pig industry has seen small farms shut due to environmental concerns, while large-scale operations are expanding. With the Federal Reserve all-but-certain to raise interest rates again this week, Asia will continue to face pressure to keep in step or see their currencies weaken. In that environment, contained food prices may not be enough to keep Asiaâ€™s central bankers sidelined, but will at least give them more flexibility than theyâ€™ve enjoyed in the past. â€œFood prices are likely to remain stable over the near term,â€ according to the UNâ€™s Broca. â€œBut we canâ€™t be sure over the longer term.â€', '6/13/2018 3:45', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Â Overview of Battersea Power Station BPS is a prime central London development that was acquired by Sime Darby Property, SP Setia and the Employees Provident Fund (â€œEPFâ€) through a competitive tender process in September 2012.Â Â Since 2012 the transformation of the site into one of the worldâ€™s most iconic and prestigious mixed-use locations has been underway creating in the process a profitable and highly valuable asset for the shareholders. More than 99% of the residential units in the first Phase, Circus West Village, have been profitably sold and today more than 1,000 people and a range of businesses call the Battersea Power Station development home. Work on the Power Station building itself is progressing well and is scheduled to open to the public in late 2020. Its c1.8m sqft of space will include 500,000 square feet of offices which have been pre-let to Apple, one of the worldâ€™s leading technology companies. This represents one of Londonâ€™s largest ever office pre-lets.Â In addition the Power Station will house 120 shops and restaurants, event space and visitor attractions, creating a new town centre for London.Â Â In addition there will be 253 residential apartments (currently 90% sold). The take-up of the space bodes well for potential investors as it is seen as a precursor to an exciting future for the Battersea Power Station development.Â The development will also benefit from the opening in late 2020 of the 3km extension of the Northern Line underground to a new Zone 1 station at Battersea Power Station. This Â£1bn investment by Transport for London will support the rejuvenation of the entire Nine Elms area including the recently opened US Embassy and a further 20,000 new homes. It is currently expected that when it opens 40 million people will visit Battersea Power Station annually. Â Funding of Battersea Power Station The site acquisition and the subsequent costs of the Battersea Power Station development have been fully funded by a combination of equity from the shareholders together with development debt provided on commercial terms by a mixed group of nine Malaysian and international lenders (of which more than 60% has been provided by the international lenders).Â Â The Â£458m development loan for Phase 1 has been fully repaid ahead of schedule. The initial capital invested into the project by the developers and the profit from the first Phase is now being reinvested into developing the subsequent phases. Â Potential reorganisation of the ownership of Commercial Assets (being the Office, Retail, Food & Beverage and other commercial uses) within the Power Station building to Permodalan Nasional Berhad (â€œPNBâ€) and the EPF.Â Â In January 2018 it was announced that the shareholders and management of Battersea Power Station were considering a divestment of the Commercial Assets and had initiated conversations with the EPF and PNB.Â Â Currently PNB and the EPF together own approximately directly and indirectly 67% of the equity in the Battersea Power Station development. PNB holds majority stakes in S P Setia and Sime Darby Property which jointly own 80% of the equity in the Battersea Power Station development whilst the EPF directly owns 20% of the Battersea Power Station development. On 18 January 2018 PNB and the EPF signed a Heads of Terms with Battersea Phase 2 Holding Company Limited to initiate preliminary negotiations to purchase the Commercial Assets for an estimated total consideration of Â£1.608 billion.Â The purchase price is subject to further due diligence and on the basis that the development is completed and fully tenanted.Â As previously assured by all parties the decision to explore the potential reorganisation of ownership is purely an investment consideration initiated by the BPS Board and management team, together with the EPF and PNB. From the perspective of Sime Darby Property and S P Setia, as property developers, the transaction will enable them to continue to reallocate capital to other areas of their development businesses. PNB and the EPF view this as a strategic opportunity to secure ownership of a unique and iconic real estate asset which will be able to deliver sustainable income streams into the future to meet their respective income needs.Â The transaction is expected to generate an attractive long term yield for the investors.

Furthermore, an â€œengulfing bearâ€ Japanese candlesticks chart pattern was formed last Friday and this indicates resistance. Technically, the trend remained bearish despite the rebound last week. The FBM KLCI is below both the short- and long-term 30- and 200- day moving averages. Furthermore, the index is below the Ichimoku Cloud and the Cloud is also bearish. Momentum indicators like the Relative Strength Index, moving average convergence divergence and oscillator are below their mid-levels and these indicate that the trend is bearish. However, theseÂ indicators increased because of the rebound last week and this indicates a weak bearish momentum. The FBM KLCI faces resistance at 1,800 points (which is the 200-day moving average) and the index is technically still in a bearish trend if it stays below this level. Therefore, the trend can only turn bullish if the index breaks above 1,800 points. If it fails to do so, the market may continue to move into a correction with support at 1,710 points.

Quarterly revenue increased for the first time in first quarter of financial year 2018 (1QFY18) (+3.1% year-on-year [y-o-y]) since 3QFY13 as the digital and commerce revenue growth outpaced the drop in TV revenue. The decline in print revenue also narrowed to only 0.6% y-o-y compared with previous quartersâ€™ double-digit contraction. Digital revenue grew to RM9.6 million from RM400,000, with net profit growing to RM3.4 million from RM200,000, mainly contributed by Rev Asia acquired by the group last year. In addition, Rev Asia is also assisting with digital-related business within the group such as print digital to improve the business. On the other hand, home shopping also delivered encouraging revenue growth of 58.8% y-o-y with net loss narrowing by 61.2% y-o-y in 1Q18. Media Prima aims to break even in its home shopping business in FY19. Moving forward, we believe that the new revenue streams from digital and commerce will be the growth driver for the group, offsetting the decline in traditional businesses, although earnings contributions are relatively small. In the near term, catalysts for the sector include pickup in advertising expenditure (adex) driven by election spend, 2018 Fifa World Cup, improvement in adex sentiment post-14th general election (GE14), and potential increase in consumer spending due to the abolishment of the goods and services tax, and increase in readership and viewership due to the promise of media freedom by the new government, more balanced reporting and the increasing news flow in the country. Evidently, most of the media companies including Media Prima have seen a pickup in readership and viewership post-GE14. Media Primaâ€™s TV adex (TV3, NTV7, 8TV, and TV9) increased by 10.6% y-o-y in April, which we believe was mainly driven by GE14, although the cumulative four months still saw a drop of 4.9%. Overall, total adex was flat y-o-y in April 2018, the month before GE14. The significant adex growth in FTA TV, radio, and cinema was offset by the decline in newspaper, magazine and in-store media adex. That said, in the long term we remain cautious about the structural shift in media consumption. Similar to its peers, Media Prima is in the midst of optimising its operations. The group reaped cost savings in 1QFY18 from a series of restructuring exercises carried out last year. We expect more cost rationalisation (such as closure/disposal of inefficient operations/assets) and also more cost savings ahead (as the group made a provision for manpower rationalisation amounting to RM58.5 million in FY17 in addition to the Early Retirement Scheme one-off cost of RM52.3 million). The group has been looking for the right buyer to dispose of its properties, especially the one in Senai, Johor (net book value [NBV]: RM19.4 million) and the one in Ajil, Terengganu (NBV: RM3.1 million), which could potentially result in a one-off sizeable disposal gain. The groupâ€™s estimated net tangible assets for FY19 still stand at 38 sen per share. We believe the groupâ€™s intangible assets such as TV programme rights still have value, adding on to this worst-case valuation. â€” PublicInvest Research, June 12', '6/13/2018 3:01', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The auditors highlighted concerns about Sumatecâ€™s ability to continue as a going concern that is highly dependent on the timely and successful implementation of a series of proposed corporate exercises pursuant to the proposed acquisition of Markmore Energy (Labuan) Ltd (MELL) from controlling shareholder Halim. Earlier in March, Sumatec won the rights from MELL to build a condensate extraction plant for the Rakushechnoye oil and gas (O&G) field in Kazakhstan. This was followed by an offer from Chinese contractor Talap Munai Service LLP to jointly develop and finance up to US$20 million for the development of the O&G field. The Rakushechnoye field is a large field with reserves, both in oil/condensate and gas, totalling around 139.4 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) of proven and probable reserves. â€œThere will be no divestment from the oilfield in Kazakhstan. We are expecting to put more money in order to get back better money,â€ Halim said. When asked how much he plans to personally invest in the project, he said that it will be â€œquite a substantial amountâ€.

At this moment, we need to restudy [the HSR project], and if we are short of funds we can delay the implementation of the project or reduce the scope of the project,â€ he told reporters in Tokyo. Earlier that same day, a Japanese news agency reported that he had conceded the need for the HSR in Malaysia â€” but that it will be meaningful only if the track is â€œvery longâ€ compared with the initial development plan. â€œThere will be a need for a HSR in the future, probably right through the peninsula. But we cannot afford it at this moment. So, we actually postponed the implementation of the project,â€ he said in an interview with the Nikkei Asian Review. The revelation is a reversal of his earlier statements in Malaysia, which was to scrap what he described as an â€œunnecessaryâ€ project that â€œwill not earn the country a single senâ€. It is unclear whether the government has communicated with the Singapore government over the official status of the HSR project. Singapore previously issued a statement saying it continues to incur costs while it awaits Malaysiaâ€™s clarification on the status of the project, but did not elaborate.

Whoever wants to build [the automaker], they can submit a proposal,â€ said Dr Mahathir. Asked for details of proposer, and whether the government has any automakers in mind to work with, he quipped: â€œI cannot [propose] any party now, because [critics will] say it is cronyism.â€ The ideaâ€™s main focus is to revive local engineering firms that have had to close after failing to supply car parts â€œaccording to the demands of the new owners of Protonâ€, he said. â€œWe have acquired knowledge to design, build and mass-produce cars.

We have to study it (the concession agreement) before we make an announcement,â€ Loke told reporters yesterday, after receiving donations to Tabung Harapan Malaysia worth more than RM2 million from two organisations: Seri Pajam Sdn Bhd and Cameron Highlands Taxi Driversâ€™ Association. When asked if the government will abolish the AES, Loke said, â€œI do not want to pre-empt anything, but we expect a decision concerning the AES to be out within [the next] one to two months.â€ At the same time, Loke said he has instructed ministry officials to come out with a â€œconcrete proposalâ€ following the review, before tabling it to the cabinet for a final decision. As for the summonses issued under the AES, he said, â€œWell, of course a lot of people have yet to pay their summonses.â€ â€œFor those outstanding AES summonses, no action has been taken so far but we will come to a decision on how to deal with the summonses,â€ he added. AES is a continuation of the Road Transport Departmentâ€™s Road Safety Plan 2006-2010, which aims to reduce traffic offence rates and subsequently minimise road fatalities. Currently, Boustead Holdings Bhd, through its 50%-owned Irat Properties Sdn Bhd, has a 66-month concession to manage the AES throughout the country. The concession contract, which was signed on Dec 9, 2011 with another five-year renewal option, was awarded to Irat Propertiesâ€™ two subsidiaries: ATES Sdn Bhd and Beta Tegap Sdn Bhd. Under the build-operate-transfer agreement, both ATES and Beta Tegap are required to establish and operate a network of AES to monitor all federal roads, highways, and expressways nationwide. According to Bousteadâ€™s annual report, since 2012, Irat Properties has drawn up bank borrowings and internal funds for the AES operation, with an initial roll-out of 14 cameras. Currently, Irat Properties is in the midst of negotiating a revised concession agreement with the government to roll out more than 300 cameras nationwide. Note that both ATES and Beta Tegap were to be remunerated based on a three-tier structure. Under the first tier, both companies would be entitled to RM16 per valid summons up to five million summonses. After reaching more than five million summonses, tier two would kick in, with the additional revenue to be split evenly between the two companies and the government up to a cap of RM270 million each. Upon reaching the cap, tier three would kick in with the companies each receiving 7.5% from the remaining revenue and the government the rest. Separately, Loke said the possibility of establishing a third national car company and improving the public transport infrastructure should not be a zero-sum game. â€œI do not see a zero-sum game on that. Letâ€™s wait for the prime minister to announce it further,â€ he added. Earlier, Loke was asked to comment on the latest statement by Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad on establishing a third national car company in collaboration with Asian countries such as Thailand, South Korea, or Japan. Speaking at the 12th Nikkei Conference on the Future of Asia in Japan recently, Dr Mahathir said the idea to establish a new national car company, which will be the third after Proton Holdings Bhd and Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua Sdn Bhd or Perodua, will enable Malaysia to produce cars catering for the global auto market. Meanwhile, Loke said the transport ministry has yet to receive any proposals to build new airports in Kulim, Kedah, and on Tioman Island, Pahang. â€œI have reviewed all the existing projects under the transport ministry. As far as I am concerned I have not seen the Kulim airport proposal on the table,â€ he added. The project to build an international airport on a proposed 600ha of oil palm land in Kidam Siri, Kulim, which is said to cost RM2 billion, has been under consideration by both the Kedah and federal governments since 2014. To be code-named KXP, the new Kulim airport is said to ease the excess passenger capacity and cargo operations at the Penang International Airport, which currently has the capacity to support 6.5 million passengers annually. As for the Tioman Island airport, tycoon Tan Sri Vincent Tan has mooted the idea to build the infrastructure at a cost of RM1.2 billion. â€œIf the proposal arrives then it is only appropriate that I will comment on that,â€ Loke added. Previously, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd managing director Datuk Badlisham Ghazali has said that the plan to develop the airport on the island was not approved as â€œenvironmental impact assessment studies showed that the project would involve land reclamationâ€. It is worth noting that Tan owns and operates Berjaya Air Sdn Bhd, which offers private and chartered flight services to more than 30 destinations in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, and China. Loke also said the government has yet to consider a plan to revive the RM2 billion Klang-Kuala Lumpur bus rapid transit project, which was scrapped by the previous administration as it would overlap with the third light rail transit project. On the RM110 billion Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail project, Loke said the government is waiting for further clarity from the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office on whether it is being reviewed or cancelled.', '6/13/2018 2:31', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

In a note today, the research house said it was slightly above house expectations, accounting for 109%, but within consensusâ€™ at 100% of full year estimates.

Entrepreneurs have had no choice but to pocket an artificially low amount and then watch their shares soar by the daily limit, over and over again. But this defining -- and distorting -- characteristic of the $7.3 trillion market may be about to change, at least for some companies. Analysts say firms selling the first-ever Chinese depositary receipts wonâ€™t be subject to the valuation restriction. Xiaomi Corp. is planning to raise $5 billion, or half of its total offering, from the new type of security thatâ€™s a high-profile attempt by Chinese officials to lure big tech firms back home. â€œTheyâ€™ve got to relax the valuation caps otherwise CDRs wonâ€™t work,â€ said Ken Wong, a Hong Kong-based fund manager at Eastspring Investments, which manages about $170 billion. â€œYou canâ€™t have these restrictive rules if you want to attract the biggest names in tech. Itâ€™s a step in the right direction.â€ Click to read more about Xiaomiâ€™s potential valuation The China Securities Regulatory Commission didnâ€™t immediately respond to a faxed request for comment on whether companies issuing CDRs will have more flexibility in pricing. Authorities published the final rules for their trial program this month, less than three months after the CDR plan was first publicly announced. The urgency signals Chinaâ€™s desire to get its most innovative firms represented in its domestic equity market, which is clogged with state-controlled dinosaurs even though China has produced some of the worldâ€™s biggest tech businesses. Though mainland retail investors have been able to buy shares of Hong Kong-listed firms like Tencent Holdings Ltd. through an exchange link with Shanghai since 2014, itâ€™s much more difficult for them to trade stocks in the U.S. Thatâ€™s where locally-cultivated technology stars like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Baidu Inc. or NetEase Inc. have opted to list. Those decisions were at least in part because of Chinaâ€™s rules for IPOs, which also include a ban on dual-class structures and an approval process thatâ€™s spawned a 300-plus backlog of wannabe listings. They were designed to protect individuals from buying into suspect companies at inflated prices. In practice, the chokehold on supply and pricing, as well as the implicit government endorsement, created an investment on which itâ€™s impossible to lose. In 2018, all 49 new listings soared by the 44 percent limit on the first day of trading, and many kept surging for weeks after that. Read more about Chinaâ€™s IPO market dynamics here With CDRs, Chinaâ€™s trying to do it differently. Officials have approved six mutual funds that may raise almost $50 billion to purchase the securities, locking in cornerstone investors for three years and making it more difficult for punters to flip the stock. The regulator has said it â€œhopesâ€ that the market wonâ€™t engage in speculation, and the government says it wonâ€™t guarantee returns or the quality of candidates. Firms that opt to bypass retail investors altogether and sell shares exclusively to institutions and high-net-worth individuals will enjoy a simpler and speedier approval, effectively allowing sophisticated investors to take on a greater role in the pricing process, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. After Xiaomiâ€™s debut, Chinaâ€™s restaurant review and delivery giant Meituan Dianping -- which plans to file for an IPO of about $6 billion in Hong Kong as soon as this month -- is considered a prime candidate to sell shares on the mainland. Higher Valuations The CDR trial â€œcan also be seen as a key reform measure of introducing global best practices to the local market, notably the new IPO approval process and pricing mechanism,â€ analysts at Goldman including Kinger Lau wrote in a note this week. Morgan Stanley says CDR valuations may be higher than those of their underlying stocks in New York or Hong Kong because mainland investors have few alternatives if they want a slice of a global tech champion. The sector, which makes up about 40 percent of the MSCI China gauge tracking offshore shares, is about 10 percent of a measure tracking A shares. Alibaba trades at about 30 times forward earnings. â€œTech stocks have historically been more expensive onshore and they represent scarce assets in that market,â€ Morgan Stanley equity strategist Laura Wang said by phone from Hong Kong. â€œBut thereâ€™s still so much more information that needs to be disclosed on the technical, regulatory and trading side for us to really understand the scale of that gap.â€ - Bloomberg', '6/13/2018 1:42', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Last week, Musk said the carmaker should achieve its target by the end of June.Shares rose as much as 7 per cent and were last up 3.6 per cent at US$344.18 (RM1,371.19).The layoffs mean there likely will not be more job cuts in the near-term, said Efraim Levy, analyst at CFRA Research, adding that Tesla will likely raise capital early in 2019.â€œI don\'t think if Tesla becomes profitable in Q3 and Q4, that will be sustainable because of ramping up of the production. The layoffs may help them to achieve profitability in the near-term but not sustain it.â€Tesla has been burning through cash as it continues to spend on its assembly line and prepares for new investments on projects such as the Model Y crossover and its Gigafactory.Free cash flow, a key metric of financial health, widened to negative US$1 billion in the first quarter from negative US$277 million in the fourth quarter, excluding costs of systems for its solar business.Several Wall Street analysts anticipate a capital raise this year despite Musk\'s statements that it will not be necessary due to profitability and positive cash flow in the third or fourth quarters.Tesla said it began notifying impacted workers yesterday and would continue to do so throughout the week. A spokesman said it would reduce overall employment back to around 37,000 â€” roughly in line with numbers at the end of last year.Musk also said that Tesla had decided not to renew a residential sales agreement with Home Depot, and would focus instead on selling its solar products through its own stores and website. The company will seek to re-employ most Tesla employees at Home Depot stores at its own locations.Musk told employees in May that the company was undergoing a â€œthorough reorganisationâ€ as it contends with production problems, senior staff departures and recent crashes involving its electric cars.At the start of April, the company\'s shares had fallen by around 35 per cent from a peak hit last September but signs that it is on course to meet an output target of Model 3 cars have wiped out almost all of this year\'s losses. â€” Reuters', '6/13/2018 1:34', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The company is considering selling about 10 percent of the company, the minimum required under Hong Kong exchange rules, to avoid dilution, said one of the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is private. Meituan is targeting a valuation of roughly $60 billion, the person said, although the valuation and fundraising target wonâ€™t be in the initial filing documents. With the first filing in June, the actual listing of Meituan shares is likely around October, the people said. Meituan is also considered a prime candidate to sell shares in mainland China as part of the governmentâ€™s program to give more opportunities to domestic investors. Itâ€™s not clear yet when the sale of Chinese depository receipts would take place. Meituan declined to comment on a potential IPO and said that if it has specific fundraising plans it will announce them at the appropriate time. The IPO is another sign of Chinaâ€™s rising might in the technology industry, which has become a flashpoint for trade tensions with the U.S. A generation of up-and-comers like Meituan are emerging to build out an industry that has been dominated by Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. Smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. is said to plan raising about $10 billion by selling shares in Hong Kong and mainland China. â€œTheyâ€™ve expanded to the point where they have successfully created a system,â€ said Mark Natkin, managing director of Beijing-based Marbridge Consulting. â€œThey need to get a lot more capital to further strengthen that.â€ Read More: Tencent Backed Super-App Emerges to Rival its Own WeChat Meituan was most recently valued at $30 billion, making it the worldâ€™s fourth most valuable startup, according to CB Insights. It is sort of a mash-up of Groupon, Yelp and Deliveroo with restaurant reviews, group-buying discounts and deliveries of food, groceries and other goods. It has more recently expanded into areas such as ride-sharing and travel. With a few taps to navigate its smartphone apps, Chinese customers can order up hot meals, groceries, massages, haircuts and manicures at home or in the office. Founded in 2010 by Wang Xing, it handled $57 billion of transactions last year between about 320 million active buyers -- about the size of the American population --- and more than four million merchants. The company however faces formidable rivals in key businesses. Itâ€™s competing with entities backed by Alibaba in food delivery, with Didi Chuxing in ride hailing, and even with its own backer Tencent in payments. It also expanded into bike sharing with a deal for Mobike said to be valued at $3.4 billion. An IPO would give Meituan additional capital to compete in existing businesses and even to expand. No final decisions have been made, and details of the offering could change, the people said. â€œThereâ€™s a lot of companies doing their IPOs and filling their war chests,â€ Natkin said. â€œAnd not to do so now would leave them in a situation where others have money to burn to either push into areas they currently dominate or to lock down areas theyâ€™re trying to expand into.â€ Didi, the ride hailing leader, has also been considering an IPO. Meituanâ€™s rapid push to go public may suck up some of the capital that would otherwise be allocated to Didi. Meituanâ€™s other existing backers include Booking Holdings Inc., Sequoia Capital, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Trustbridge Partners, Tiger Global Management, Coatue Management and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC. Those investors and more have handed Meituan $7.3 billion in funding over the past two years. Itâ€™s now also begun promoting the use of its own digital wallet on its app: it handles about a fifth of overall transactions on its platforms. Tencent accounts for about 60 percent while Ant Financialâ€™s Alipay and others contribute about 20 percent. â€œMeituan has been expanding its business from offline stores selling fresh products to online cab hailing, and also purchased Mobike earlier this year,â€ said Yang Xin, a researcher at Analysys International. â€œThey are in need of a large amount of capital to support all those businesses.â€ - Bloomberg', '6/13/2018 1:22', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

The move resembles the scenario during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis when the country sought the assistance from the Japanese to help resolve its financial difficulties while going on an austerity drive. With the cost likely to be lower and the tenure longer, a yen loan was a feasible and an attractive proposition to pare down the more expensive dollar borrowings, especially the ones incurred by 1Malaysia Development Bhd, said Sunway University Business School professor of economics Yeah Kim Leng â€œIt also signals that the governmentâ€™s fund-raising capacity in international financial markets was not impaired by the high debt level, as well as affirming the continuing foreign investor confidence in the country under the new government,â€ Yeah said when contacted by StarBiz. He added that currencies of countries with stronger output and productivity growth tend to have higher appreciation prospects. â€œThe yuan in the long term, therefore, has a strong likelihood of appreciating against the ringgit, thereby rendering loans from China more expensive to service in the future,â€ he noted. Yesterday, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who was on a working visit to Japan, said he asked Japan to extend a yen credit to Malaysia, adding that his counterpart Shinzo Abe had agreed to consider the request. The Prime Minister also plans to reduce Malaysiaâ€™s debt to China. With Dr Mahathirâ€™s good relationship with Japan, a line of credit in yen is seen as a positive given that the country is facing with a high public debt of RM1.09 trillion, said economists. Following the Asian Financial Crisis in 1998, Malaysia sought aid from the Japanese Official Development Assistance (ODA) when the country ran into financial difficulties, according to AmBank Group chief economist Anthony Dass. Dr Mahathir was then the Prime Minister . â€œAid was given in the form of ODA. We have been seeking financial aid from the Japanese government since the First Malaysia Plan and would have been exposed to a total of more than US$2.8bil (RM11.18bil) to help the process of modernising Malaysia,â€ he noted. According to him, the latest move by the Prime Minister indicates the country could potentially run into difficulties due to the huge public debt and the need to reduce fiscal deficit to gross domestic product which stands at 2.8%. Seeking credit assistance from Japan would likely continue though the Japanese ODA, he said. The loans could come at a special rate of around 1% or even lower, depending on the type of projects. Those loans would be over a long period of 30 to 40 years. â€œIt could be used for economic development and to support small and medium-scale industries with the aim of ensuring the economy continues to grow at a sustainable pace, while not straining liquidity at the same time,â€ said Dass.Economists said that while the yen credit would help support economic activity, it would also provide room for the government to continue â€œcleaning upâ€ the red files without causing any major dent on economic growth. â€œOn our end, we need to create the level of transparency, governance and reforms to ensure the past mistakes are not repeated and that the credit line is used in the best interest of the country,â€ Dass added. â€œAlso, we need to ensure there is no tolerance for lacklustre and complacent attitudes as it would raise the reputation risk and could signal that the country may risk defaulting on the credit line utilised.â€', '6/12/2018 16:00', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The platform was responding to the recent call by The Malaysian Association of Hotels (MAH) to regulate Airbnb to ensure that all stakeholders have an even hand in the industry. â€œWe have worked with hundreds of governments around the world to develop clear and sensible frameworks that support respectful and responsible home sharing. As a new chapter unfolds in Malaysia, Airbnb is committed to working with the government to continue promoting authentic Malaysian hospitality and tourism to the rest of the world,â€ Airbnb head of public policy for Southeast Asia Mich Goh said. She highlighted that Malaysia has firmly established itself as one of Airbnbâ€™s fastest growing markets in Asia over the past few years with more than 1.5 million guest arrivals from over 176 countries, reflecting a significant 137% annual growth. â€œMalaysia is our most popular destination and the fastest-growing market within Southeast Asia alone. We continue to grow because tourists increasingly want new and authentic adventures when they travel. â€œIn fact, 84% of our guests globally use Airbnb because they want to live like a local, and 44% of all guests spending takes place in the neighbourhoods where they stay. For them, Airbnb is the antidote to modern, mass tourism and a gateway to experience true Malaysian hospitality,â€ she said. She also pointed out that hospitality is a growing market and Airbnb is growing the sector by making travel more accessible and affordable for more people than ever. She added that they have been having â€œmeaningful and productive conversationsâ€ with the government and local industry stakeholders. â€œThe Airbnb community contributed RM200.4 million to the Malaysian economy in 2017 alone. A typical Malaysian host earned RM4,790 in 2017 and because hosts keep 97% of the money they charge, thatâ€™s more revenue generated for local communities that do not typically benefit from tourism,â€ she said. She also added that home sharing platforms like Airbnb offer the ability to adjust, if not correct, property market imbalances by enabling thousands of homeowners to share their homes and earn vital supplemental income. â€œThis is especially beneficial in Malaysia where the current residential overhang has generated 130,690 unsold and unutilised apartments worth RM20 billion, and led the government to limit construction of new apartment buildings,â€ she concluded.

Exxon now aims to trade around more of its growing energy assets to get the best prices for its products and increase earnings, according to an employee familiar with the matter.Expanded trading could add hundreds of millions of dollars to annual earnings from its own buying and selling of crude and fuels, but also comes with problems, including higher risk. Exxon expects to add one million barrels per day of output over the next several years as new oilfields and refinery expansions kick in, giving it more assets to trade.Exxon last year retained John Masek, a former trader at Swiss-based Glencore , the worldâ€™s second largest buyer and seller of petroleum, to consult on gasoline trading. Earlier this year, it poached four gasoline market specialists from refiner Phillips 66 .This month, Exxon hired former BHP Billiton Plc trader Nelson Lee as an international crude trader, the people familiar with the matter said. In 2014, Lee orchestrated BHPâ€™s first-ever crude exports by maintaining the lightly refined oil met criteria for an exportable product. The deals helped usher in the end to a US prohibition on crude exports more than a year later.The company has also added crude, products and liquefied natural gas specialists to London and Singapore offices. It recently hired Paul Butcher, a trader who has worked at BP Plc , Glencore and Vitol, to advise on North Sea markets and accounting for trading transactions.â€œPaul is known for being a very aggressive, old school crude trader. Exxon would have never hired a risk taker of that scale in the old days. The fact that he is consulting them shows they are considering changes in trading very seriously,â€ said a trading house executive who knows Butcher.Phillips 66 declined to comment on the employee departures.Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri referred questions about its trading business and recent hiring to regulatory filings, which note the historical use of financial derivatives and geographic scale to manage commodity price risks.Limited riskChief Executive Darren Woods wants to increase Exxonâ€™s profit and appetite for risk at a measured pace, according to people who deal with Exxon. The US operation runs from a trading floor at its Spring, Texas campus that has expanded to as many as 70 workers who will handle everything from Canadian crude to gasoline, jet fuel and diesel.â€œTrading has been a virtual four-letter word at Exxon,â€ said Ehud Ronn, a University of Texas finance professor who studies energy and financial risk management. Exxon has drawn most top managers from engineering backgrounds, not financial services. â€œA change in their trading policy would indeed be transformational.â€Exxon has long lagged behind rivals BP Plc , Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc , which have created trading units that occasionally generate more profit than their refining businesses.During the oil price downturn of 2015-2016, companies like Shell often made more profit in refining than in oil production, also known as upstream, and often cited trading as contributing to the success of the refining division.Shell for example trades more than eight million barrels per day or 8 per cent of global production, twice the size of its own or Exxonâ€™s output. The huge figures come partially thanks to trading barrels of third parties, which Exxon currently does on a very limited scale.Exxon would also normally hedge only cargoes going from one region to another and where crude is priced according to different benchmarks. BP and Shell would normally hedge all cargoes as well as taking sometimes a pure speculative position on the paper market to make profit, according to traders working for the firms.â€œExxon still doesnâ€™t plan to begin speculative paper trading,â€ said one source familiar with Exxonâ€™s thinking.Woods faces pressure from Exxon investors to lift shares that trade at the same price as 10 years ago. He promised shareholders this year that he can double profit and increase its oil and gas output by 25 per cent by 2025.The companyâ€™s expanded focus on trading brings challenges including added risk from options, swaps and other derivatives, and developing risk-management and compensation systems for the larger business.Exxon has held talks with at least two developers of risk-management software, Enuit LLC and Allegro Development Corp, people familiar with the discussions said. Both offer packages that manage logistics and measure financial exposure. The companies declined to comment on their discussions with Exxon, according to spokespeople.Exxon has also put company veteran managers in charge of overall trading and risk controls at its Spring, Texas, floor, one person familiar with its operations said, to avoid potential losses as it expands trading.â€œWeâ€™ve heard whispers in the market about this for a few years, so itâ€™s great to see them finally hiring commercial talent externally,â€ said an executive recruiter familiar with some of the recent hires but who was not directly involved. â€” Reuters', '6/12/2018 15:36', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

He has been supporting most of the companyâ€™s costs and expenses within his personal capacity but declined to disclose the amount he has invested so far. Asked how much more he intends to invest in the company, Halim, who holds a 12.7% stake in Sumatec said: â€œAs much as I can afford.â€ Moving forward, the company remains confident of its business operations despite falling into Practice Note 17 (PN17) status based on its share price, its products and global oil price. He said the group is working on a regularisation plan that would address its PN17 status, legacy debt or shipping debt amounting to RM230 million owed to creditors and its future operations. He added that the plan, which is being drafted based on the assumption of oil price at US$64 (RM255.36) per barrel, will be submitted to Bursa Malaysia â€œvery soonâ€. At the current oil price of US$75 per barrel, Sumatec makes a profit of US$30 to US$35 per barrel. In April, the group was classified as a PN17 company following its external auditors Grant Thornton Malaysiaâ€™s disclaimer opinion on its financial statements ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY17). It has about 10 months to submit its regularisation plan. Sumatec recorded a net loss of RM113.95 million and RM171.06 million at the group and company levels respectively, as well as a negative cash flow of RM15.33 million and RM9.86 million for FY17. In the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, Sumatec posted RM457,000 in profits compared with a net loss of RM743,000 a year ago. Earlier in March, Sumatec had received an offer from Markmore Energy (Labuan) Ltd (MELL) for the development of a condensate extraction plant (CEP), as well as an offer from a contractor for the development and financing of the oil field for up to US$120 million (RM478.8 million). The plant facilities comprise a gas and liquid separator, contaminant removal unit, methane and ethane separation unit, CEP fractionation unit and propane and butane treater. It will take 18 months from the date of signing of the gas supply agreement to be completed. MELL holds the entire interest in CaspiOilGas LLP, which is the concession owner and operator of the Rakushechnoye oil and gas field located in Kazakhstan. Halim is the director and 99.9% shareholder of MELL. However, Halim said Sumatecâ€™s board of directors have yet to decide on MELLâ€™s offer and nothing has been formalised at this juncture.', '6/11/2018 23:21', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Aramco pumps around 10 million bpd of crude oil.â€œOur strategy is very simple. We want to be at eight to 10 million barrels per day of participated (refining) capacity... (and) we are going forward by trying to be a top leader in chemicals by 2040,â€ Judaimi said.â€œThe market that we want to grow in... has to be growing, a strong market, with good demand and of course these assets have to be integrated to the whole value chain of the downstream,â€ he said in an interview at Aramcoâ€™s headquarters in Dhahran.To help it reach these targets, Aramco has entered a 50 per cent joint venture with three Indian refiners to build a US$44 billion (RM176 billion), 1.2-million-bpd refinery integrated with petrochemical facilities on Indiaâ€™s west coast.Aramco has said it may introduce a strategic partner to share its 50 per cent stake in the Indian refining venture.Judaimi said Aramco was working with Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (Adnoc) toward securing a partnership. It would be the first time for the two national oil companies to join hands in an international venture.â€œWe are now finalising the MOU (with Adnoc) that would cover certain commercial principles between us,â€ he said, adding that the memorandum of understanding would be finalised this year.Â He said front-end engineering for the project could start by early 2019.Apart from India, Aramco is also taking a 50 per cent stake in Petronasâ€™ huge RAPID project in the southern Malaysian state of Johor.Aramco hopes this will help it dominate supplies in India and Malaysia, two of the worldâ€™s fastest-growing oil markets after China, and where growth potential is bigger than in other, more developed regions. Aramco is eyeing three separate refining and petrochemical projects in China, Judaimi said.â€œAsia has to have the lionâ€™s share... We believe markets east of the Suez Canal will continue to grow, including the Middle East as well,â€ Judaimi said, adding that the United States is â€œanother market we want to grow inâ€.In April, Aramco said it was integrating a petrochemicals business into its subsidiary Motiva, the United Statesâ€™ biggest oil refinery.Aramco is strengthening its refining role in China, one of its biggest customers. It has a refinery joint venture with Sinopec and Exxon Mobil and is in talks with CNPC to finalise the purchase of a stake in a 260,000-bpd refinery in Yunnan.Judaimi said he expects to take a final investment decision on the Yunnan refinery, which is operational, by the end of this year.â€œWe are in the final stage of negotiations. Itâ€™s like building a house â€” the last touches take much longer.â€Aramco plans to build a 300,000-bpd refinery with Chinaâ€™s Norinco. Judaimi said he expects to finish front-end engineering for the Norinco project by mid-2019, following which the company will take its final investment decision.Judaimi said Aramco had also started negotiations for a third refinery in China.â€œItâ€™s a smart refinery with higher conversion of liquids into chemicals,â€ he said, declining to give details.â€˜Last man standingâ€™Aramco has been integrating its refining with petrochemicals to help the company expand its market share and refined products portfolio.The company is betting on growing demand for fuel in India and South-east Asia but also shifting more into petrochemicals in case those consumption forecasts prove too optimistic.â€œIn the long term, we are thinking of investing more into chemicals,â€ he said.â€œWe know the world needs chemicals... as populations grow they need more plastic,â€ he added.One centrepiece of Aramcoâ€™s push into chemicals is a project it is building at home with Saudi Basic Industries Corp (Sabic), the worldâ€™s fourth-biggest petrochemicals company.The US$20 billion project with Sabic is to build a complex that converts crude oil into chemicals directly, bypassing the refining stage. Judaimi said Aramco would make a final investment decision by the end of 2019.â€œThis is a very critical programme and we are going to do all we can to make it happen,â€ Judaimi said.â€œWe believe we are the last man standing in terms of energy supply. Our cost position on the upstream side, our reliability, our location and our infrastructure are all competitive advantages to us.â€ â€” Reuters', '6/12/2018 14:04', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Today, Brent oil stood at nearly US$76.The oil price will be a critical factor when Opec and its partners meet in Vienna next week to decide on a possible extension of a production cut deal â€” which crucially included giant producer Russia â€” that has been key to the oil price recovery.â€˜Whippy marketsâ€™Opec kingpin Saudi Arabia in January publicly floated the idea to extend the cooperation agreement which was struck by 24 Opec and non-Opec producers in late 2016 to trim output to shore up prices.Opec secretary general Mohammad Barkindo in April praised the agreement as a â€œgreat successâ€.The oil market is on high alert ahead of the June 22 meeting, sector analysts reported, saying there were signs that Saudi Arabia and Russia would push for higher production ceilings at the meeting.US President Donald Trump has personally called on Saudi Arabia to increase output to curb rising prices and help boost the economy.â€œMarkets are braced for the most fractious conference as Opec members look fundamentally divided,â€ said Phillip Futures analyst Benjamin Lu.â€œExpect more of the same whippy markets driven by rumours and innuendo ahead of June 22 Vienna Opec meeting,â€ predicted Oanda analyst Stephen Innes.Opecâ€™s own oil production rose slightly in May, the monthly report showed.Production fell in Nigeria, Libya and Venezuela, but increased in Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Iraq.Iranâ€™s share of Opec production increased slightly last month, possibly a sign that the countryâ€™s crude exports have not yet been affected by the US decision to ditch a landmark international nuclear accord with Tehran and re-impose damaging sanctions. â€” AFP', '6/12/2018 12:34', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

No need to abolish toll immediately, I mean they understand. They know it was mentioned in the manifesto, now that reality has come in, they understand the financial position and the problem.â€œWe have worked all these things up. We will try to do in such a way that it balances everything. The market will be happy, the owners are happy and the consumers are happy,â€ said the 80-year old who believes in hard work and determination.The toll abolition was one of Pakatan Harapanâ€™s election promise in the run-up to the 14th general election.Daim also explained that the announcements to cancel and review mega-projects did not mean that the government was shifting the focus of the economy.It simply is driven by the fact that some of these projects do not make any sense.For example, he said the MRT projects cost a lot of money.â€œJust compensation for the land is huge. And itâ€™s only in Kuala Lumpur, what about other places?â€ he quipped.He added that the economy remained largely driven by domestic demand with private consumption spending accounting for 54 per cent of overall Gross Domestic Product.As such, the government is merely being fiscally responsible in expenditure to manage fiscal debt position, he explained.â€œAny projects that benefit the rakyat should be continued, but we have to review all projects to make sure that they are cost effective and no hanky-panky is involved,â€ said the diminutive tycoon who is known to keep a tight control on finances during his corporate days.Meanwhile, Daim also expressed confidence that revenue from the new tax regime and the savings from rationalising operational expenses can cushion the possible revenue shortfall from the scrapping of the GST.The government is also undertaking reforms to ensure wastage and leakages are minimised.â€œThat RM43 billion (revenue from GST) is excluding the refunds. In the 80s I wanted the GST. Other countries also have GST but the money collected goes back to the rakyat. Here it only went to BR1M.â€œThat is why the rakyat is upset. Here GST is charged from the time before you were born until you die whereas, in the western country, GST take care of you from the time you were born until you die,â€ he said.The CEP expects positive market confidence, said Daim, as the government has reiterated its stance to be transparent, pursue measures to eradicate corruption, undertake prudent fiscal spending and managing the debt situation.â€œThe investors should welcome these measures. The confidence must come back, it will take a little bit of time. Now the people are watching to see what the government is going to do.

The research house added that this will reinvigorate the groupâ€™s overall re-rating process. AmInvestment Bank is maintaining a â€œbuyâ€ call on Sapura with an unchanged fair value of RM1 a share. On Monday, Sapura and its partners Sarawak Shell and Petronas Carigali made its ninth gas discovery offshore Sarawak in the Pepulut-1 exploration well, which encountered a high quality reservoir, following the completion of its 2017 drilling campaign within the SK408 production sharing contract (PSC). Sapura E&P is the development and production operator with a 40% working interest in the SK408 development. The estimated reserve for Pepulut has not been revealed yet. â€œGiven that this field is in the vicinity of the Gorek, Larak and Bakong fields of phase 1 in the SK408 PSC, which achieved final investment decision in April this year, we expect this discovery to further enhance the viability of this project cluster by leveraging on the common infrastructure, pipelines and facilities,â€ AmInvestment Bank said. As the first three fields will be developed as three separate wellhead platforms tied back to the existing processing facility and to the MLNG complex in Bintulu, it expects Sapuraâ€™s fabrication yard utilisation to improve significantly towards the end of the year. The group already secured two Hess wellhead platforms and the Pegaga central processing platform from Mubadala Petroleum. The research house said E&Pâ€™s FY20 production is expected to fall by 12% year-on-year from natural decline. However, the Gorek, Larak and Bakong gas fields in the US$200 million Phase 1 of the SK408 PSC are targeted to commence production in FY21, radically transforming annual gas output from 2 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) to 12 million boe and propel overall hydrocarbon production to 13.4 million boe, up 3.8 times from 3.5 million in FY18. The fields under the SK408 gas field development project, which have an estimated reserve of 2.8 trillion cu ft of gas, are part of the discoveries made by Sapura E&P in its 2014 drilling campaign. The SK408 gas fields will be Sapura E&Pâ€™s second major upstream gas development project in East Malaysia, after the successful development and commencement of production from the groupâ€™s 30%-owned SK310 B15 gas field late last year.

Including additions in the United States and Australia, liquefaction projects currently under construction are projected to increase global capacity by 13.5 bcfd by 2022, EIA said. One billion cubic feet of natural gas is enough to fuel about five million U.S. homes for a day. In 2017, there were 19 LNG exporting countries and 40 importing countries.

Banks extended a record 13.53 trillion yuan in new loans last year, 7 per cent more than the previous record in 2016.China is in the third year of a regulatory push to reduce risks in the financial system and regulators continue to roll out measures to improve supervision and risk control in the financial sector.However, there are expectations the central bank could loosen some of its policy settings to ensure the crackdown on risks and resulting hit to credit growth does not hurt the real economy.The Peopleâ€™s Bank of Chinaâ€™s surprising cut in reserve requirement ratios (RRR) on April 17 and fears of a trade war with the United States have fanned market expectations of looser policy to support the economy.Capital Economics expects the Peopleâ€™s Bank of China to raise the interest rate it charges on its reverse repos if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates as expected this week, in a symbolic response as economic growth and inflation pick up.â€œBut the PBOCâ€™s move will be aimed at narrowing the gap between the market and reverse repo rates rather than to tighten monetary conditions. Indeed, officials have not allowed market rates (a better gauge of monetary conditions) to rise since May last year,â€ Capital Economics said in a note.â€œAnd we think they will loosen policy later in 2018 as slower credit growth feeds through to a softening in activity.â€Banks doled out a record 2.9 trillion yuan in new yuan loans in January, and extended 7.19 trillion yuan in the first five months of the year.Despite the wider slowdown, the property sector remains a risk with household loans, mostly mortgages, rising to 614.3 billion yuan in May from 528.4 billion yuan in April. That means household loans accounted for 53.4 per cent of total new loans in May, versus 44.8 per cent in April.Corporate loans fell to 525.5 billion yuan in May from 572.6 billion yuan a month earlier.Broad M2 money supply grew 8.3 per cent in May from a year earlier, missing forecasts for an expansion of 8.5 per cent and compared with 8.3 per cent in April.Outstanding yuan loans grew 12.6 per cent from a year earlier, slower than an expected 12.7 per cent rise and compared with a rise of 12.7 per cent in April.De-risking campaignLast month, sources told Reuters that China will â€œactively and steadilyâ€ deleverage, citing the countryâ€™s five-year plan (2016-2020) for the financial sector.The campaign has made progress in reducing alternative and murkier funding sources for companies such as shadow banking, but it has also slowly pushed up borrowing costs, which has made more companies concerned about tightening credit conditions and spurred default risks.The weighted average lending rate for non-financial firms, a key indicator reflecting corporate funding costs, rose 22 basis points in the first quarter to 5.96 per cent, following a rise of 47 basis points in 2017.In recent weeks, the Chinese authorities have stepped up policy support to the economy to make sure there is ample liquidity in the financial system.Chinaâ€™s total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, dropped sharply to 760.8 billion yuan in May from 1.56 trillion yuan in April, data from the central bank showed today.TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales. â€” Reuters', '6/12/2018 11:25', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

It is sort of a mash-up of Groupon, Yelp and Deliveroo with restaurant reviews, group-buying discounts and deliveries of food, groceries and other goods. It has more recently expanded into areas such as ride-sharing and travel. With a few taps to navigate its smartphone apps, Chinese customers can order up hot meals, groceries, massages, haircuts and manicures at home or in the office. Founded in 2010 by Wang Xing, it handled US$57 billion of transactions last year between about 320 million active buyers â€” about the size of the American population â€” and more than four million merchants. The company however faces formidable rivals in key businesses. Itâ€™s competing with entities backed by Alibaba in food delivery, with Didi Chuxing in ride hailing, and even with its own backer Tencent in payments. An IPO would give the company additional capital to compete in existing businesses and even to expand. No final decisions have been made, and details of the offering could change, the people said. Didi, the ride hailing leader, has also been considering an IPO. Meituanâ€™s rapid push to go public may suck up some of the capital that would otherwise be allocated to Didi. Meituanâ€™s other existing backers include Booking Holdings Inc, Sequoia Capital, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Trustbridge Partners, Tiger Global Management, Coatue Management and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC. Those investors and more have handed Meituan US$7.3 billion in funding over the past two years. Itâ€™s now also begun promoting the use of its own digital wallet on its app: it handles about a fifth of overall transactions on its platforms. Tencent accounts for about 60% while Ant Financialâ€™s Alipay and others contribute about 20%.', '6/12/2018 10:31', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a press conference half an hour later.â€œWe see hawkish overtones from the decision to raise rates and our expectation that the statement will no longer say that the (federal) funds rate is likely to remain below the long-run neutral rate for some time,â€ Barclays analyst Michael Gapen wrote in a recent research note.â€œAs the (Federal Open Market Committee) closes in on neutral, we see it as less likely to make promises on the path of policy,â€ Gapen said, referring to the level at which monetary policy neither boosts nor slows the economy.Accommodative or notFutures contracts indicate a 96 per cent probability the fed funds rate will be raised a quarter of a percentage point tomorrow, according to CME Group.Fed policymakersâ€™ updated forecasts will show whether they continue to expect only one additional rate increase over the rest of the year, or feel recent strong job and economic data justify a second one in the near term, and perhaps a boost to the number of rate hikes expected next year.The US central bank raised rates in March and policymakers say they expect two more upward moves before the end of the year. The Fed raised rates three times last year.For several weeks, Fed officials have been indicating that changes to the statement may be in the works, though they have not been clear about the likely extent of them.According to the minutes from the last policy meeting and policymakersâ€™ statements since then, some Fed officials feel the fed funds rate is already at or near â€œneutral,â€ and therefore should no longer be described as â€œaccommodative,â€ or directly encouraging investment and spending.Analysts see such a shift as less likely at this point.The last time such a change occurred was in September 2005 when rates were raised from 3.50 per cent to 3.75 per cent, â€œinto the range of (neutral) estimatesâ€ given by Fed staff at the time, Goldman Sachs analysts noted.The phrase â€œpolicy remains accommodativeâ€ was merely removed, with no substitute language or explanation.Currently, the core of Fed policymakers feel the neutral rate is around 2.9 per cent â€” allowing leeway for perhaps three or four more rate increases â€” and some argue it may well be rising given the impact of the Trump administrationâ€™s tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus. â€” Reuters', '6/12/2018 9:54', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Now, analysts are saying the smartphone giant he built could be twice as expensive as Apple Inc.Xiaomi Corp deserves to trade at a premium to global phone brands due to its market-share gains and faster growth trajectory, according to research from Morgan Stanley, one of banks leading its Hong Kong IPO. The Beijing-based company has a fair value of about US$65 billion (RM259 billion) to US$85 billion, translating into around 27 times to 34 times forecasts for its 2019 adjusted earnings, Morgan Stanley wrote in a report this week.Thatâ€™s roughly double Appleâ€™s valuation of 14.5 times estimated 2019 adjusted earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Xiaomi should also fetch richer multiples than rival smart hardware makers like Fitbit Inc and GoPro Inc, as well as some major Chinese internet firms including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Baidu Inc, according to Morgan Stanley.While such pre-deal research is prepared by a bankâ€™s equity analysts, not their investment bankers, it may provide a clue into how Xiaomi plans to sell its growth story. Xiaomi, which has been planning to seek about US$10 billion, is considering raising about half that from its Hong Kong IPO and the other half from an offering in mainland China, people with knowledge of the matter have said.Xiaomi could be valued at as much as US$92 billion given the strong growth in its cash flows beyond 2020, JPMorgan Chase & Co analysts wrote in a separate report. Its success is based on offering â€œworld-class productsâ€ at low prices while selling high-margin services, according to CLSA Ltd.Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes at Xiaomi could rise at a compound annual growth rate of 58 per cent annually over three years, hitting 29 billion yuan (US$4.5 billion, RM18.1 billion) by 2020, CLSA estimates. The Chinese company could boost smartphone shipments 42 per cent this year to 130 million units, analysts at CLSA wrote in a research report.They may rise further to 179 million shipments in 2019 and 218.6 million units in 2020, CLSA said. Thatâ€™s in the neighborhood of the 216.8 million iPhones shipped by Apple in its latest financial year.Services revenueXiaomi has emerged as the gateway to about 100 million users in China, who are monetised via a suite of online services, Goldman Sachs Group Inc analysts wrote in their own report. Analysts at the bank, one of Xiaomiâ€™s IPO sponsors, gave Xiaomi a forward equity valuation range of US$70 billion to US$86 billion. That translates into 26 times to 32 times its forecast adjusted 2019 net income, according to Goldman Sachs.â€œXiaomi integrates the internet user experience with hardware to offer an unrivaled user experience,â€ Goldman Sachs wrote in the report. â€œThe companyâ€™s hardware aggregates traffic, its software builds platforms, and its internet services generate revenue and profit.â€The Chinese company is coming to market as the smartphone industry plateaus: Replacement cycles are lengthening, even as more mature markets approach saturation. Xiaomi is trying to increase higher-margin services as a proportion of revenue.CLSA, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are leading Xiaomiâ€™s Hong Kong IPO as joint sponsors, according to an exchange filing last month.

In a second reading in a row to show a loss of momentum in pay, total earnings, including bonuses, rose by an annual 2.5 percent, the Office for National Statistics said, down from growth of 2.6 percent in the three months to March. Economists polled by Reuters had mostly forecast growth of 2.6 percent, matching the pace of the three months to March. Central banks in many rich countries have been stumped by the failure of wages to follow their typical pre-crisis pattern of rising quickly as unemployment falls. Excluding bonuses, growth in earnings fell for the first time in more than a year, rising by 2.8 percent year-on-year against expectations for growth to hold at 2.9 percent in the Reuters poll. But the number of people in work rose by a larger than forecast 146,000, pushing up sterling briefly. â€œItâ€™s a really strong set of employment figures,â€ Andrew Wishart, an economist at Capital Economics, said. â€œIt looks like thatâ€™s set to continue.â€ The BoE expects wages to pick up speed gradually over the next three years, a big reason why it says it is likely to raise borrowing costs gradually over the period. But last month it said it wanted to be sure the economy had recovered from its near-stagnation in an unusually icy early 2018, before pushing ahead with only its second rate hike since before the global financial crisis. On Monday, data showed British factories had a weak April. Tuesdayâ€™s data showed that in the month of April alone â€” when employers often give staff their annual pay rise â€” regular pay was up by 2.5 percent, its weakest increase since November. However, the unemployment rate held at 4.2 percent in the three months to April, its lowest since 1975, as expected in the Reuters poll. Households - whose spending is the main driver of Britainâ€™s economy - struggled last year from the double whammy of slow wage growth and a jump in inflation, due in large part to the fall in the value of the pound after the 2016 Brexit vote. With unemployment so low, employers have generally been raising pay for staff more quickly, albeit still more slowly than increases of about 4 percent a year that were typical before the global financial crisis. Data due on Wednesday is expected to show British consumer price inflation edged back up to 2.5 percent in May, but remains well below a five-year peak of 3.1 percent set in November. The BoE said in May that it expected pay growth of 2.75 percent a year by the end of 2018, rising to 3.5 percent by the end of 2020.', '6/12/2018 9:54', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

According to the company, the survey â€” which covered 475 cities worldwide and compares a basket of like-for-like consumer goods and services commonly purchased by assignees â€” found that both Malaysia and Thailand have risen in the rankings, with Bangkok entering the global top 100 for the first time. â€œIn the case of Malaysia, especially in Kuala Lumpur, this shows that the inflationary impact of the imposition of GST (Goods and Services Tax) seems to have been brought under control. Rather, it is the relative appreciation of each countryâ€™s currency that saw Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur rise in our rankings to 99 and 182 respectively,â€ said ECA International Asia regional director Lee Quane in a statement today. Another interesting finding was that Singapore had re-entered the top 20 most expensive cities in the world. However, despite rising four places, Singapore is still ranked lower than its peak in 2016 when it ranked 18th place. â€œThe prices of goods and services have only seen modest increase in Singapore over the past 12 months, in line with other similar economies in Asia. The rise in the rankings has been due to the relative strength of the Singapore dollar versus the US greenback in the past year,â€ Quane said. Meanwhile, Hong Kong saw a significant drop in the rankings, falling from the second most expensive location in the world to the 11th â€” its lowest position since 2015 â€” due to the fall in value of the US dollar against which the Hong Kong dollar is pegged over the last year, he noted. He added that exchange rates have been the main cause of movements in the rankings in the past 12 months. â€œCurrency movements have been quite volatile with several emerging market currencies strengthening against the US dollar in the last year.â€ On the other hand, every one of the Chinese cities included in the survey has seen a rise in the global rankings from last year. Shanghai was the highest-placed Chinese city on the list at 10th place overall. â€œThere has been a major rebound for the Chinese cities in our latest Cost of Living survey. Last year we reported that Chinese locations had all dropped in the rankings but 12 months later the long-term upward trend has resumed, and they have risen significantly.

Munchy had 14% share of Malaysiaâ€™s US$112 million sweet biscuit market in 2017, the second-biggest maker in the country, Euromonitor data show. The CVC Asia IV fund has made five investments in the past 12 months, including deals for GarudaFood and Munchy, the person said. In December, CVC bought a stake in Riraku, a Japanese operator of relaxation-therapy centers, and a month later, it invested in Vietnamâ€™s Asia Commercial Bank, its website shows. The fund also said last month it agreed to buy OANDA Global Corp, an online retail trading platform. CVC was part of a consortium including Employees Provident Fund and Johor Corp that bought QSR Brands (M) Holdings Sdn Bhd in 2013.

Risks for the company, going forward, include lower average selling prices (ASP) amid stiff competition, rise in nitrile and latex prices and stronger ringgit against the US dollar. Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) said that Top Gloveâ€™s revenue grew 15.7% year-on-year (y-o-y) on volume growth, while profit after tax and minority interests declined 21% y-o-y due to higher raw materials cost. HLIB is keeping a â€œholdâ€ rating on Top Glove with a lower target price of RM5.20, from RM5.49 previously based on an unchanged price-earnings multiple of 18 times calendar year 2018 earnings per share. HLIB noted that despite seeing a 29.4% growth in revenue, on the back of higher ASP due to higher raw material prices y-o-y, volumes declined 1% as clients held back their orders. It expected the effect of ASP revision in the third quarter of FY17 to be quantified in the fourth quarter of FY17. â€œRaw material prices of natural rubber latex and nitrile have tapered off significantly since May. â€œWith the revision in ASP, stable US dollar and lower raw material prices, going forward, we can expect earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation margin to recover to the 14% to 15% level in the coming quarter,â€ HLIB said. Given that raw material prices saw a correction recently, this could lead to a rebound in volume in the fourth quarter, the house noted. CIMB Research reiterated a â€œholdâ€ call on Top Glove, from an â€œaddâ€ rating with a higher target price of RM5.75 from RM5.61 previously. â€œWe raised our target price to RM5.75 (based on 19 times calendar year 2018 forecast price-earnings), but downgrade the stock to â€˜holdâ€™ as it is fairly valued,â€ CIMB said. The house expects Top Glove to book stronger results in the fourth quarter, with net profit in the region of RM85mil to RM90mil. This could come in on the back of stronger sales volume and lower raw material prices. â€œTop Glove should also benefit from the time lag in lowering its ASPs to reflect the decline in raw materials. â€œMeanwhile, new capacity from Factory 30 that has a capacity of 2.8 billion per annum, will gradually come on stream beginning August. AmInvestment Bank (AmInvest), meanwhile, maintained its â€œholdâ€ rating, with a fair value of RM5.44. The research house said Top Gloveâ€™s share price had recently scaled its fair value of RM5.44, despite it raising its earnings earlier by 3% to 5% for FY18 to FY19 forecast to account for capacity expansions. Similarly, AmInvest said other major glove players have also seen a surge in their share prices, mainly due to decline in latex prices in May to June, 2017. â€œWith lower latex prices, we could expect volume to improve in the coming fourth quarter,â€ AmInvest noted.

But like it or not, some legal investment schemes are not always very fair to investors either. Take some of the interest schemes that are registered with the Companies Commission of Malaysia (CCM). Some do turn out to be fraudulent, with the companies offering these schemes attempting to swindle investors of their money, while some viable schemes get terminated even before they reach maturity. While the terminated cases are not necessarily fraudulent, as investors do get back their capital plus some returns in most instances, the unprofessional or unethical way of the companies offering those schemes cut short investorsâ€™ hope and expectations of a longer period of sustainable annual returns plus capital gains at the end of the investment period. At present, there are 205 interest schemes registered with the CCM. These schemes involve the pooling of financial contributions from the public in exchange for an interest in a particular scheme. For investors, it is an opportunity to diversify their portfolios while for companies, especially the small and medium enterprises, an interest scheme offers them an alternative method of funding their business growth. Of the registered schemes, 39 have have been terminated â€“ 10 of which were asked to do so by court order â€“ for various reasons. There are 15 others categorised under the â€œrefer interest scheme sectionâ€ and these include some offered by companies that have been sued for fraud and failure to comply with rules. Meanwhile, the number of still-active schemes stands at 151. This number will be down to 150 soon, as it has become clear that the Golden Palm Growers Scheme (GPGS) will soon be terminated. Early termination Just seven years into its launch, GPGS is set to be the second local oil palm growers scheme to be terminated after the collapse of Country Heights Growers Scheme (CHGS) in 2013. Golden Palm Growers Bhd, the management company of GPGS, is expected to meet with investors on Monday to explain the rationale for the proposed early termination of the 23-year scheme that has so far collected an estimated RM212.4mil from investors. While investors have enjoyed the guaranteed annual returns of 6% plus a discretionary bonus during the first phase of the scheme from 2010 to 2016, they are now left in a lurch, wondering whether they can get back their initial capital. But if CHGSâ€™ case were a gauge, then perhaps investors can take some comfort. When CHGS, a scheme founded by Tan Sri Lee Kim Yew in 2007 and managed by Plentiful Gold-Class Bhd, was terminated in 2013, investors were compensated with a goodwill payment of RM25mil on top of the full refund of their initial capital. Prior to the termination of the scheme, investors were estimated to have already gained a total of RM78.5mil in yields during the first five years of investment. According to a financial adviser, it is only fair to compensate investors with some additional payment on top of their initial capital if an investment scheme were to be terminated earlier than its maturity period. â€œThere should be some capital gain based on the market value of the business to be fair to investors,â€ the financial adviser, who requested anonymity, argues. He questions whether some schemes are just making use of investors. â€œCompanies get the money from investors to help them build a business, and compensate the investors accordingly during the first few years, but when the business reaches a stage where it can generate better returns, these companies want to terminate the schemes because they no longer want to share profits with the investors,â€ the financial adviser says. â€œWhile this is not illegal, it does raise the question of ethics and professionalism ... so, it is fair to compensate investors with some capital gain â€“ or goodwill payment, whatever you call it â€“ if the companies want to terminate the investment scheme,â€ he points out. In the case of oil palm growers schemes, the financial adviser says the fair value of compensation can be based on the available benchmarks. â€œIt is not too difficult to value an oil palm plantation business. This is because there are proper benchmarks â€“ such as international crude palm oil prices, the value of trees based on age profile and the market valuation of the plantation land â€“ that can be used to derive the fair value of the business at its prevailing stage,â€ he explains. So far, the main recourse for investors who have invested in oil palm growers schemes that have turned sour is the Minority Shareholder Watchdog Group to fight for their rights. Share-farming schemes Excluding GPGS, there are still three active oil palm growers schemes registered with the CCM. They were launched between 2011 and 2014. These are categorised under share-farming schemes, which also comprise livestock-related investment plans that allow investors to participate in the breeding of livestock such as swiftlets and catfish for commercial purposes. As it stands, three of the four aquaculture-related share-farming schemes registered with CCM have already collapsed. The companies offering the three aquaculture-related share-farming schemes had been charged in court for fraud and mishandling of investment funds around 2012-2013. It is unclear whether investors managed to recoup the money they had put into these schemes that were launched between 2011 and 2012. These schemes were supposed to come with a maturity period of five years, promising quarterly fixed returns during harvest, throughout the investment tenure. CCM did not respond to StarBizWeekâ€™s e-mail on the status of the terminated aquaculture-related share-farming schemes. Meanwhile, the two swiftlet share-farming schemes registered with CCM are still active. They were launched in 2010, promising high annual returns in the form of vouchers and interest payments throughout the investment period of 35 to 36 years. For instance, one company claims that for an initial investment of RM12,000 for one unit of its swiftlet share-farming scheme, the investor has the potential to earn up to RM270,000 in 35 years, which translates into an average annual return of more than 75%. The company claims the projection has been verified by â€œestablished independent swiftlet ranching consultantsâ€. A financial adviser, however, argues that while swiftlet farming is a credible business backed by robust demand from Greater China and countries with large Chinese communities, it is still difficult to ascribe a fair value to the business. â€œThere is no official or proper benchmark for the swiftlet farming business. So, the fair value at best is a matter of opinion and uncertain,â€ he argues. To be fair, swiftlet farming is an important industry for Malaysia. It is one of the 131 entry point projects under the Economic Transformation Programme. The Government expects swiftlet farming to contribute RM4.5bil to the countryâ€™s gross national income by 2020. Meanwhile, a share-farming scheme involving agarwood plantation has made its debut in Malaysia after being approved by CCM last year. In general, agarwood plantation is an industry promoted by the Malaysian Timber Industry Board, which has in recent years pointed out that agarwood production in the country can hardly meet the export and domestic demand due to the limited supply availability. In Singapore, however, agarwood investment schemes have raised eyebrows. At least one such scheme in the city-state has closed down, with no compensation in sight for investors, while another has come under increasing scrutiny by authorities. Stories such as these go to show that the public has to enter investment schemes with their eyes wide open even when it comes to schemes that are legal. But it also calls for authorities to be more stringent with companies offering interest schemes. â€œThe key appeal of interest schemes â€“ from share-farming plans to golf and recreational clubs to time-sharing plans and memorial parks â€“ lies in their promise of steady and attractive returns throughout the investment tenure,â€ a financial planner says. â€œAnd what convinces investors to part with their money is the fact that they are regulated schemes. So, regulators need to ensure better enforcement of rules to ensure that companies offering these schemes play a fair game with investors,â€ he adds.', '9/29/2017 16:00', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

You see, no matter how promising or plausible the project is, to my mind, there are more failures than successes when it comes to tech products launched on crowd-funding platforms. So why am I talking about this in my photography column? Well you see, I recently ordered a smart camera cable and dongle from a company called Triggertrap â€” the cable is a pretty cool product which allows you to connect your smartphone to your DSLR remote port. As you may well imagine, connecting a camera to your smartphone allows you to use the smartphone as a souped-up remote control that can do many things, such as utilise your phoneâ€™s microphone to trip the shutter release when it hears a sound such as clap. Another interesting feature is that it can utilise your smartphoneâ€™s GPS to detect distance travelled so, for example, you can have the Triggertrap trip the shutter and take a photo after a certain distance has been traveled. The thing about the Triggertrap cable is that it was the result of a highly successful Kickstarter campaign in 2011 and the company has since built up a relatively successful business selling the said cable and dongle combo. I held back buying one of these cables for quite a while because it was relatively expensive for the number of times when I was likely to use it. However, it was recently on sale and I decided to take the plunge and purchase one from the Triggertrap website and waited for mine to arrive. That\'s why I was quite surprised when a couple of months later, I get an e-mail from Triggertrap telling me that they have been unable to source the cable for my specific camera and have cancelled my order and refunded me my money. A few days later the penny dropped â€” I got an e-mail from Triggertrapâ€™s CEO that the company was closing down its business because of heavy debts incurred when the companyâ€™s Project Ada Kickstarter project failed. Project Ada? In case you haven\'t heard of Project Ada, the story goes that after successfully selling the Triggertrap smart cables, the company embarked on a more ambitious project called Ada which was intended to be a smart trigger that uses modular sensors to detect the environment and trigger the shutter. So for example, if you fit in a laser sensor, you could utilise it to trip the shutter when, say, a bullet passed in front the sensor. Similarly, an infrared sensor could be utilised to sense and take a photo when an animal passed by in front of it.Â Project Ada was actually a hit on Kickstarter â€” the campaign far exceeded its original US$79,000 (about RM350,000) goal, bringing in US$464,000 (about RM2.06mil), and it looked like it was going to be another successful product for Triggertrap. Unfortunately, reality eventually hit when the company spent five times too much money on its prototype and eventually found out that the parts for the final product were going to be more expensive than initially budgeted for. Despite getting a bit more financial help, Triggertrap had to eventually throw in the towel and cancel the project altogether. Unfortunately, the cancellation of Project Ada resulted in a domino effect of failure for the company which it has evidently never been able to recover from. So that\'s the end of that.Â While it\'s sad that a company like Triggertrap has fallen, it\'s also a cautionary tale for the rest of us to beware of projects that promise too much. I\'ve come to believe that without massive research and development budgets afforded by big multinational companies for creating complicated electronic products on top of relatively short delivery dates, most Kickstarter projects of this type are destined to fail. In fact, Triggertrap is just the latest in a growing list of companies that have been successful on Kickstarter and yet were unable to build a profitable business from that. So what do you think? Do you have any stories of projects you\'ve supported on crowd-funding platforms that have failed?

The findings were presented at the UN Public Service Forum 2017 that was held on June 22-23.The forum was a platform for decision-makers to share their strategies and innovative approaches as well as the valuable lessons learnt in the process of mobilising public institutions and public servants towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).The overarching theme of the forum was â€œPublic Service Innovations from around the world to leave no one behindâ€. The forum was divided into eight parallel tracks. Norashikin participated in track one on job creation and prosperity, where she shared about SL1Mâ€™s effective ways in handling and promoting job creation, decent work opportunities and prosperity.Apart from addressing a high youth unemployment rate, the initiative reflects the Governmentâ€™s commitment to achieve a high-income nation status by 2020, which essentially means better quality of life, better wealth distribution, better growth opportunities and higher living standards. SL1M ensures that there are equal opportunities for poor rural and urban youths to be part of the economic development ecosystem.SL1Mâ€™s milestonesSince its inception in 2011, SL1M has aided over 125,000 young graduates in enhancing their employability through soft-skill and on-the-job training which is offered in partnership with government-linked companies (GLCs) and the private sector.Norashikin said, â€œthe delegates at the forum were especially impressed and surprised to learn about how involved the private sector is with SL1M. Because, many of them find it rare or not so simple for collaboration to occur between both the private and public sectors within the nationâ€.SL1M has steadily assisted graduates both directly and indirectly through its â€œOutreach Programmeâ€ or â€œSearch and Assist Programmeâ€.â€œI am so thankful for this golden opportunity to share what SL1M has done and receive such positive feedback from various countries participating in this forum. More so, it is such a blessing to help disadvantaged Malaysians get opportunities to succeed and improve their circumstances,â€ Norashikin said.How graduates and companies benefitSL1Mâ€™s Outreach Programmes and Open Interview Programmes include anywhere between 60 and 100 GLCs and private companies offering thousands of opportunities â€“ in various industries â€“ for attendees to grab.Among the regulars are big players such as Affin Bank Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd (Celcom Axiata Bhd), Boustead Holdings Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Khazanah Nasional Bhd, Kumpulan Wang Simpanan Pekerja, Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera, Lembaga Tabung Haji, Malayan Banking Bhd, Malaysia Airlines Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Malaysian Building Society Bhd, Malaysian Resources Corporation Bhd, Permodalan Nasional Bhd, Petronas, Sime Darby Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd and UMW Holdings Bhd. Forty per cent of the companies participating in SL1M are from the service industry, 16% from finance and investment and 11% from logistics and transport. There are also participating companies from the agricultural, construction, oil and gas, communication and utilities sectors.Companies have been incentivised to participate in the SL1M programme via double-tax deduction or a HRDF-SL1M incentive which allows them to claim for expenditures incurred in the training of graduates.Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak also encouraged public-listed companies to take part in SL1M as this would put them on the priority list when securing government contracts.Furthermore, SL1M serves as a meaningful form of corporate social responsibility that enables companies to improve the economic status of fellow Malaysians while grooming future leaders and skilled members of the workforce. Itâ€™s a full circle as these trainees then make up the talent pool that companies require for their own expansion.This way, companies not only gain access to SL1Mâ€™s participantsâ€™ database to find the right candidates for their training programmes, they also save on hiring and retraining while eliminating the need for external recruitment experts to find the right fit for the organisation.At the end of the day, itâ€™s a win-win situation for graduates and corporations.Social collaborationAs corporations handle the technical training aspect, SL1M has assisted tens of thousands of graduates directly and indirectly through their motivational, outreach, and soft-skills training that are carried out in collaboration with partner organisations. The soft-skill programmes guide graduates to improve their confidence, competence, communications, resume skills and professional appearance.Leaderonomics â€“ a social enterprise driven by the desire to transform the nation through leadership development â€“ is one of the partner organisations which has taken a lead in empowering undergraduates with soft-skills that will help them secure potential employment opportunities.The Leaderonomicsâ€™ Campus team has been part of SL1Mâ€™s roadshows, offering a free â€œCV Clinicâ€ that helps improve studentsâ€™ curriculum vitae (CVs) while building their confidence to face employers during job interviews.These nationwide roadshows have garnered tremendous support from over 300 participating companies and have witnessed great turnouts from students, graduates and job-seekers. The recent roadshow in Kuala Lumpur saw some 50,000 attendees while the ones in Sarawak and Kedah had over 20,000 and 25,000 attendees, respectively. Last weekendâ€™s roadshow in Sabah attracted a crowd of more than 10,000 people.â€œFor SL1M Sabah, if an applicant secured a job and needs to move out of their hometown (especially to the Peninsular), they can claim transportation cost (flight tickets, etc) from either the companies or SL1M. Applicants need to get certified letters from authorities in their respective hometowns stating that they are unable to fund themselves,â€ said Norashikin.The turnout for the roadshows dispelled the myth that young graduates were apathetic or lackadaisical about their careers and future as graduates enthusiastically flocked the event to meet potential employers.There is also an Open Interview Programme 2017 at every roadshow.

Companies were looking at ways to diversify into different business segments to spread their risk and vary their revenue sources. But successful entrepreneurs have advised SMEs to know their market and where possible, concentrate on their core busines. To grow and be successful, companies need to know their market and customers before jumping into anything, said ExcelVite Sdn Bdn chief executive officer WH Leong. Many companies tend to invest in other ventures without researching and studying the market, he noted. â€œDo not jump in just because you want to join the bandwagon. Donâ€™t just dive into something you are not familiar with. Many companies fall into this trap and lament their plight. â€œPersonally, I read a lot and understand the market nature before making any decisions. If they are able to nurture their core and attributes, they will be on the right track when it comes to growth,â€ he told participants at the Star Outstanding Business Awards (SOBA) 2017 Learning Series workshop in Ipoh. However, entrepreneurs should not be afraid to venture into uncommon fields if they do see a potential for growth, said MK Curtain Group managing director Datuk Calvin Khiu Fu Siang. Khiu, who spoke at the workshop in Johor, shared his background story as an example of someone who took the plunge because he was confident about the potential of his business. Khiu went from selling kuih at night markets to running a thriving textile business. â€œIf you are born into a rich family, you would find a diamond among the gold. But if you are not born with a silver spoon, then youâ€™ll need to find gold among trash,â€ he said. The speakers at the Learning Series workshops also shared their thoughts with the participants on what contributes to a successful business. Leong reminded business owners that their employees are the companyâ€™s best asset and are vital in helping the company grow. â€œIf you get at least 70% of your employees to believe in what you do, they would do anything for you. They would not mind taking the bullet for you because they feel the company is like their baby too. That is what I always tell the staff at ExcelVite,â€ he added. Khiu agreed, adding that there was also a need to provide a sense of security as well as a sense of direction, belonging and accomplishment for your employees. â€œYou have to explain to your workers on where your company is heading. Treat them as family and they will do the same in return, and share your successes with them so they feel included,â€ he said. Khiu also attributes his success to three core values: gratefulness, respect and positivity. â€œWe have to be grateful and have mutual respect for our employees and customers, as they are the backbone of our business, without which a company cannot grow. â€œKeeping a positive vibe is also important, there is no point in complaining because while we may not be able to change the world, we can change ourselves first,â€ said Khiu. Meanwhile, Feruni Ceramiche Sdn Bhd managing director Datuk CC Ngei noted that there were four methods to achieving a sustainable business, which are cultivating talent, giving back to the community, keeping the industry interesting and running a value-based organisation. Ngei said the ultimate goal for a business should be to bring happiness to its employees and stakeholders. â€œThus, the methods will surround the goal,â€ said Ngei, who also spoke at the workshop in Johor. Ngei also advised SMEs not to limit their business potential and to create more value-added services to keep their clients happy. The final Learning Series workshop for the year will be held in Petaling Jaya on July 27 at Menara Star. The workshop will feature 3R Quest Sdn Bhd director Jerome Heah who will share about the companyâ€™s success in running a successful and green business.

These are platform-based businesses, mass customisation 2.0, â€˜frugalâ€ or low-cost model, modern barter, pay-what-you-want model as well as the mega hyperlocal model. The tumbling cost of technology, rising startup culture, availability of new tools, network capital and an evolving socio-economic environment have affected the way businesses serve their customers and how consumers acquire their goods and services. This has levelled the playing field somewhat for small businesses against larger companies. McGhee notes that platform-based businesses, which are digitally enabled marketplaces to match buyers and sellers, are already thriving with the likes of Uber and Airbnb. Similarly, the rise of on-demand versus in-store purchases and growing support for local brands have helped models such as mass customisation 2.0 and mega hyperlocal to prosper. â€œThese models, or a combination of them, present routes to changing the ways that people live and work. Many of the models overlap and this points to an emerging â€˜plug and playâ€™ culture where features can be combined to create hybrid solutions that apply to specific opportunities for meeting customer needs in the 21st century. This contrasts with the rigidity of a one-size-fits-all past,â€ she says.Although these models are relatively new, McGhee opines that they are sustainable models for the future. She notes that models such as marketplaces and barter systems have existed for hundreds of years. However, the new models are much more about looking at the holistic impact of businesses. â€œItâ€™s not just about the bottomline. Youâ€™ve got to look at the value that is created for the society as a whole. So itâ€™s actually bringing in a much more inclusive society and not just focused on the small percentage of very wealthy organisations or individuals.â€œAlready there is a move away from just short-term profits for businesses and towards longer term value-creation for organisations. An example of that is integrated reporting, which is not just about the financial numbers, but also about what impact am I having in terms of human capital. How do I treat my employees, do I pay them a fair wage or am I giving them the right training and development? There is also the environmental capital about how I am using finite resources.â€œSo itâ€™s important for businesses to think long term and make the right decisions for its long term sustainability or the long term sustainability of the wider society,â€ she explains. Granted, it may be more difficult to precisely measure the different elements under integrated reporting, but McGhee says it is not impossible.â€œYou can look at how you create the right culture and then measure the productivity element from it, for example. If you think about the value of a company according to its accounts, and then value the company by its share price, the share price will usually be around 85% higher than the value of the company in the accounts. So youâ€™ve got this huge intangible value that the market already measures. â€œSo I think all this intangible value for a company with these new models can be measured, itâ€™s just more difficult. But it doesnâ€™t mean companies shouldnâ€™t try,â€ she says.No doubt, it will be easier for new companies to adapt and take advantage of the new business models but McGhee says established companies can still bring the entrepreneurial spirit into the company.â€œBigger companies may not necessarily be the driver. They can partner with innovators and bring them in to deal with individual projects or invest in them. Letâ€™s remember that innovation continually happens. You will have more innovation coming through. So ultimately, you have to work in partnership to bring in the innovation,â€ she adds.McGhee urges small businesses to explore these new models and to look at new ways of evaluating their businesses to ensure that they are not left out in the changing business landscape. â€œThe disruption will happen so I think itâ€™s important that rather than run away from it or pretend it wouldnâ€™t happen, that you run with it and embrace it. â€œAnd they will embrace it in varying levels and degrees. Not everyone will become a master in digital overnight,â€ she says.', '7/23/2017 16:00', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Second-generation entrepreneurs say it can sometimes be frustrating when their parents insist on managing the company their own way and refuse to move with the times.In that sense, Sena Traffic Systems Sdn Bhd director William Tan Wei Lun thinks he is fortunate that he doesnâ€™t face those problems. He describes his father, Datuk Tan Boon Hock, as a â€˜typical conservative Chinamanâ€™ but not in a contemptuous way. A lot has been said about the typical â€˜Chinamanâ€™ but for William, his fatherâ€™s persistent, straightforward and sincere traits are something worth learning from.William joined the company after graduating with a degree in civil engineering. He had big shoes to fill, he says, when his father decided to groom him in 2014 to move the company forward.Unlike conventional business school lessons, which start by understanding profit and loss, William learned something deeper and more meaningful from his father: donâ€™t lose yourself because of business.â€œMy father tells me this every day, nobody will look up to you if you have a bad character, no matter how much money you make,â€ he says.Senior Tan has a simple guide to live by, which is to understand the seriousness of each activity.â€œThere are things that we can do and there are things that we can do but within certain constraints, and then there are total no-go zones. If these things are compromised, our life is gone,â€ William says.Tan advises William to prioritise others and to approach everyone with good intention. If others are happy with your deeds, you will be happy too, Tan often says.Having started his son early on learning values and character building, Tanâ€™s challenge for William when he came into the company was to learn to live the life of an entrepreneur.William has also learned a lot from his father about the business and the importance of taking a long-term view rather than just â€œwhatâ€™s in it for me nowâ€.â€œMy father got into a business that he knew nothing about. Principles aside, he saw long-term potential in growing this business and he also knew that it was the right choice for Malaysia to develop its own traffic management technology as vehicle users are on the rise and we can reduce reliance on foreign technologies,â€ he says. It made good business sense, he adds.William notes that foreigners rarely do a full technology transfer, which makes the maintenance of the system expensive as there would be recurring and costly upgrades and consultation fees.â€œAdditionally, we know our Malaysian drivers better. The foreign system is developed based on the drivers profile in their continent,â€ he says.Whether the companyâ€™s operations would be profitable or not in the near term was secondary to Senior Tan, whose eyes are fixed on delivering quality products to the clients. Because of this, Tan made sure that extra attention was given to ensure its products and services are up to standard. For example, when Tan felt the network connectivity for its system was not up to expectations, the company decided to upgrade the infrastructure it uses to improve network connectivity so that road users will be able to benefit.â€œThe contract stipulates that there must be connectivity. We can use either wireless networks or fibre optics. Wireless networks would incur lower cost but there would be a compromise on the data quality. We decided to go with laying the fibre optics cable although it cost us a few times more. We did it because this will be able to achieve the full potential of the intelligent traffic management system,â€ William says.Sena Traffic is also expanding the development of its system through Memorandums-of-Understanding with three local universities for industrial attachment placements for undergraduates to do their training and research. This ensures that product development is not stagnant and that the company can continue to innovate and improve its system in the future.The tie-up with educational institutions would also help the companyâ€™s sustainability in the long run as it encourages more knowledge-sharing and training of potential talents in relevant areas.This, says William, probably goes against the stereotypical â€˜Chinamanâ€™ mindset of keeping everything to yourself. Itâ€™s all about taking the long view, indeed, a valuable lesson from his father.', '7/23/2017 16:00', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

This is so that any significant fluctuation in the BLR will not burden the borrowers as the banks will normally increase the instalment amount when that happens.Another questionable area in the banksâ€™ loan evaluation process is the manner in which they compute the applicantâ€™s income. In the past few years it is believed that most banks wantonly exclude income derived from part time jobs or businesses even though it is common knowledge that large numbers of our working population actually rely on side income.The mushrooming of nasi lemak and other food stalls and of course the popularity of e-commerce businesses and ride-hailing services such as GRAB offers a clear evidence to this reality. Therefore banks really need to shake off their old mindset and embrace this new reality.Our country is now undergoing a massive revamping and rebooting, in a determined effort to get rid of unfair practices and regressive laws in order to create a fair, just and equitable nation which benefits every level of society without neglecting anyone.So likewise the banks should also review their roles within the context of the New Malaysia.It is high time they climbed down from their lofty position to revisit their original role as bankers and humbly â€œget down to the basicsâ€ in the area of nation-building.Practically all the banks have been reporting annual profit in billions of ringgit these past few years. Shouldnâ€™t they now contribute a small part of that huge profit back to the rakyat especially to lighten the burden of those in the lower and middle income groups?*This is the personal opinion of the writer and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.', '6/6/2018 16:09', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

According to a statement, the minister also â€œrejects unilateral decisions by some oil producers without consulting the rest of the membersâ€ of the agreement.Top exporter Saudi Arabia told Opec that it raised oil output to slightly more than 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in May, a source familiar with the matter said, but still within its agreed target.Even as Opec trims output, production from non-Opec members, including the United States and Russia, is rising.Russian news agency Interfax said on Saturday that the country\'s production had surpassed its target, hitting 11.1 million bpd in early June.In the United States, the number of new rigs drilling for oil rose by one last week to 862, its highest since March 2015, data from energy services company Baker Hughes showed.That suggests US output, already at a record 10.8 million bpd, will climb further. â€” Reuters', '6/11/2018 22:36', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a press conference half an hour later.â€œWe see hawkish overtones from the decision to raise rates and our expectation that the statement will no longer say that the (federal) funds rate is likely to remain below the long-run neutral rate for some time,â€ Barclays analyst Michael Gapen wrote in a recent research note.â€œAs the (Federal Open Market Committee) closes in on neutral, we see it as less likely to make promises on the path of policy,â€ Gapen said, referring to the level at which monetary policy neither boosts nor slows the economy.Accommodative or notFutures contracts indicate a 96 per cent probability the fed funds rate will be raised a quarter of a percentage point tomorrow, according to CME Group.Fed policymakers\' updated forecasts will show whether they continue to expect only one additional rate increase over the rest of the year, or feel recent strong job and economic data justify a second one in the near term, and perhaps a boost to the number of rate hikes expected next year.The US central bank raised rates in March and policymakers say they expect two more upward moves before the end of the year. The Fed raised rates three times last year.For several weeks, Fed officials have been indicating that changes to the statement may be in the works, though they have not been clear about the likely extent of them.According to the minutes from the last policy meeting and policymakers\' statements since then, some Fed officials feel the fed funds rate is already at or near â€œneutral,â€ and therefore should no longer be described as â€œaccommodative,â€ or directly encouraging investment and spending.Analysts see such a shift as less likely at this point.The last time such a change occurred was in September 2005 when rates were raised from 3.50 per cent to 3.75 per cent, â€œinto the range of (neutral) estimatesâ€ given by Fed staff at the time, Goldman Sachs analysts noted.The phrase â€œpolicy remains accommodativeâ€ was merely removed, with no substitute language or explanation.Currently, the core of Fed policymakers feel the neutral rate is around 2.9 per cent â€” allowing leeway for perhaps three or four more rate increases â€” and some argue it may well be rising given the impact of the Trump administration\'s tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus. â€” Bloomberg', '6/12/2018 6:30', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Analysts at the bank, one of Xiaomiâ€™s IPO sponsors, gave Xiaomi a forward equity valuation range of US$70 billion to US$86 billion.

Tealive has plans to expand the brand to China. â€” Picture via Facebook.com/TealiveAsia KUALA LUMPUR, June 12 â€” Loob Holding Sdn Bhd, the creator of Malaysiaâ€™s Tealive bubble tea brand, today announced a joint venture with two Chinese companies to bring 500 Tealive stores to China within three years. The Malaysian company inked the deal with Zhejiang Boduo International Trade Co Ltd and Shanghai Panfei International Trade Co Ltd at an elaborate ceremony attended by retail and franchise industry officials as well as Government representatives from both Malaysia and China. CEO Bryan Loo signed for Loob Holding which will take a 51 per cent Â majority stake in the joint venture which will be known as Shanghai Loob Boduo Food and Beverage Co Ltd, subject to company registration approval by the relevant authorities in China. Signing for the Chinese partners were their executive directors, Yu To for Zhejiang Boduo International Trade and Pan Junfei, for Shanghai Panfei International Trade. Loo said the joint-venture would see the first Tealive outlet opening in Shanghai this September before more stores are opened in other targeted cities. He expressed confidence that the joint-venture would be able to achieve the targeted 500 stores in three years.â€œBarely six months after the birth of Tealive, we took the brand to Vietnam and we now have five outlets. We have penetrated the Australian market with our first store there next month. â€œJust last month, we appointed our Master Franchisee in India and we are targeting 140 outlets within five years. Once again, Loob has achieved a â€˜breakthroughâ€™ being the first Malaysian bubble tea brand to enter India,â€ said Loo. Noting that China, the worldâ€™s largest tea market, will be the fourth overseas market for Tealive, Loo said this augured well for the progress of Loobâ€™s â€œbreakthroughâ€ campaign where the brand encouraged Tealive lovers to always push the boundaries and achieve â€œbreakthroughâ€ results in all their endeavours.Loo said Tealive served 2.5 million consumers each month in its 175 outlets and the brand was still expanding every week. On prospects in China, Loo said latest indicators were that the market for tea in China had now exceeded US$21 billion (RM84 billion) per year. â€œThere is so much history about tea in China. Already the Chinese now drink five times more milk tea than coffee. We can safely say that with the arrival of pearl milk tea to mainland China some years back, coffee has taken a backseat,â€ he added.Loo sees great potential in this venture into China. â€œWe are happy to seal this partnership with Zhejiang Boduo Holding Group and Shanghai Panfei. We look forward to a long and mutually beneficial relationship with them,â€ he said.Yu Tong, Executive Director of Zhejiang Boduo, described Loob Holding as a great partner with a strong determination to introduce modern tea culture throughout the region and the world.Yu said besides being the worldâ€™s largest tea market, China was today also the largest tea producer and exporter known for supplying some of the worldâ€™s best tea. He forecast that Chinaâ€™s tea market would continue to boom.Another indicator, Yu added, was that tea accounted for only 7.0 per cent of the total domestic beverage consumption in 2000 but it more than tripled its â€œshare of the throatâ€ to 26.0 per cent in 2015.â€œIn the past five years, the overall industry volume has been increasing at an annualised rate of 4.5 per cent Â to an expected US$21.1 billion in 2018,â€ he said.The agreement signing ceremony was witnessed by Tan Sri Datuk Ter Leong Yap, President of the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry Malaysia (NCCIM); and President of the Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia (ACCCIM), Datuk Vincent Choo, Deputy President of Malaysia Retail Chain Association (MRCA), Datuk Haji Radzali Hassan, Chairman of Malaysian Franchise Association (MFA) Â and Henry Chen, Vice President of Boduo Investment Group.', '6/12/2018 8:12', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Last year, the government collected about RM44 billion in revenue from the implementation of the GST and with the SST in the pipeline, the government was only expected to accrue approximately RM30 billion in revenue, annually. However, to date, how the SST mechanism would be implemented is still unknown as studies are still being conducted by the Finance Ministry and its related agencies. The reimplementation of SST would also have to be tabled and passed in the July sitting of the Parliament, which would also repeal the GST Act 2014. Tan also said the SST was a simpler and better tax model for Malaysiaâ€™s current economic situation. â€œPrices will drop. However, there are various factors that cause prices of goods to go up. Consumers need to understand that SST will only apply to manufacturing and services industries.

The bank has drawn up plans to consolidate as many as 10 Southeast and South Asian countries â€” potentially including Indonesia and India â€” under a new Singapore subsidiary as soon as next year, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the details arenâ€™t finalized. Itâ€™s intended to allow the bank to manage its assets and capital more efficiently and could potentially reduce the size of the emergency buffers regulators require the firm to maintain, one person said. Standard Chartered is also consolidating some of its non-China North Asian countries such as South Korea into a separate Hong Kong subsidiary, said the people. The plans arenâ€™t final and could change, the people said. â€œThe group is strongly capitalized and is highly liquid, and as you would expect, we continually look at ways of optimizing the groupâ€™s capital and liquidity structures,â€ Standard Chartered said in a statement on Tuesday. Chief Executive Officer Bill Winters is still seeking to convince investors he can restore earnings growth and generate an acceptable level of profitability while cutting costs. Winters has spent much of his three-year tenure cleaning up the balance sheet and culture of the firm after a poorly managed expansion by his predecessors saddled the bank with bad loans. The bank suffers from high compliance and management costs, because it operates in about 60 markets. The restructure could pave the way for a partial sale or listing of the new units in the future, said the people. However, this is not on the immediate horizon, the people said. Standard Chartered will be able to consolidate its liquidity and capital by uniting several countries in a move executives hope will reduce its regulatory requirements, one of the people said. At the moment, the bankâ€™s balance sheet is fragmented and that is constraining lending and growth, the people said. Fitch Skeptical Fitch Ratings Ltd analyst Sabine Bauer said any significant changes to the corporate structure would probably be driven by regulatory considerations and not just cost savings. But she doubts that such a move would free up capital because the bank may have to allocate more to the units in the region. â€œThe bankâ€™s strategic focus on Asia could justify changes to the current setup,â€ said Bauer, a Hong Kong-based senior director at the ratings company. â€œHowever, Iâ€™m a bit skeptical if incorporating more operations locally would generate capital benefits for the group.â€ The plan is an extension of an announcement in February that it would absorb its retail, commercial and investment bank in Singapore into one unit, one of the people said. Singaporeâ€™s state-owned investment fund Temasek Holdings Pte is among Standard Charteredâ€™s investors, with a stake of more than 15%, according to the bankâ€™s annual report. The London-based lender already has secondary listings in Hong Kong, where its history dates back to 1859, and India. Standard Chartered is overwhelmingly reliant on Asia for earnings, generating two thirds of its revenue and most of its profit last year. Greater China and North Asia accounted for about 40% of the lenderâ€™s 2017 revenue and 82% of its profit, while the Southeast and South Asia segment contributed almost 27% of revenue, yet only 14% of profit, largely because of high losses on bad loans.', '6/11/2018 17:30', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The pound held gains following the labour-market data and was at US$1.3414 as of 9:32 a.m. London time. With inflation slowing to 2.5% on average between February and April, households enjoyed the strongest period of real wage growth for more than a year, though pay, including bonuses only matched the rate of CPI. Key Month Regular private-sector pay slowed to 2.9% in the latest three months, and the figure for April alone dropped sharply to 2.5%, the least in five months. April is a significant month for wage settlements, as it marks the start of the new financial year for both the government, which employs more than 5 million workers and sets the statutory minimum wage, and many private-sector firms. Around 40% of all pay awards take effect during the month. In the public sector, the government is relaxing seven years of pay restraint. However, only a handful of settlements will have been included in the April data, which showed pay growth staying at 2.5%. Any coming pay rises are likely to be backdated to April, as was the case with the recent settlement for more than 1 million National Health Service workers.', '6/12/2018 9:01', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Some investors warn the sector could experience a downturn toward the end of this year, if those companies fail to deliver revenue growth. SenseTime specializes in systems that analyze faces and images on an enormous scale and works with policing bodies across China.

And RHB Bank Bhd, which has a new five-year strategy, is looking to help them do just that. Jeffrey Ng, the bankâ€™s head of group business and transaction banking, says the digital economy is the biggest trend impacting SMEs, and many of them will require assistance to adopt the technology. Ng was previously head of RHBâ€™s SME division. â€œThe business environment is definitely changing, which also impacts the way SMEs run their businesses. It is about the digital economy and we are talking about a big push into e-commerce and a cashless environment,â€ says Ng. â€œAll of this obviously translates into different cash flow needs as well. So, that is why I think banks need to rethink the way they do lending to a more needs-based kind of solutions rather than just purely general requirements [as it is] today.â€ For RHB, this means onboarding SMEs into its electronic financial supply chain platforms. Suppliers and buyers can perform payments for goods entirely on the bankâ€™s platforms and receive payments instantly. SMEs that want to offer cashless payments can also do so with RHBâ€™s solutions. If they encounter a need for financing at any point, the bank can create solutions for that particular trade. â€œFor example, when they trade within a marketplace, the bank will have a lot of transactional information and it will be able to provide financing when required for that particular transaction when they need it,â€ says Ng. It is a strategy that the bank has pursued for several years. In 2015, it introduced the SME e-Retail Solution Package, which equips retailers with an electronic point-of-sale (POS) system, online cash management, cloud accounting software and mobile POS solution, among others. â€œToday, you donâ€™t have to go to different vendors to get all of these solutions. Instead, you can come to RHB and open a bank account. And because you are a retailer, we can actually introduce you to an electronic POS system that gets linked to a mobile POS system, where you can receive card payments,â€ says Ng. â€œYou can go cashless because that is where the market is moving. This electronic POS system can also be linked to an accounting system. So, your sales will get updated in the books, and we have payroll solutions all put together for these guys.â€ Another solution it has is the iSmart tool, which helps SMEs understand RHBâ€™s products. The bankâ€™s relationship managers are equipped with tablets that have the programme installed. By answering a few questions on the tablet, SME customers can understand what solutions could work for their specific situations. â€œThe model immediately gives them a sense of how much they have to pay and what is available to them,â€ says Ng. Â iSmart also allows SMEs to measure themselves against their peers in the industry. Going forward, the bank plans to create more products that are designed based on the ecosystem SMEs operate in. For instance, one solution it is working on is a tool that will allow SMEs to apply for financing digitally. â€œToday, they can already apply for a long or current account through the SME portal. After that, they can just go into a branch and obtain the account instead of having to line up and wait to apply,â€ says Ng. In addition, with more SMEs in its ecosystem, RHB can utilise the data collected from digital transactions to help SMEs analyse trends such as their customer demographics and even when they should restock. â€œThey can make informed decisions as they move along. That is what we are trying to promote within the SMEs themselves â€” the use of a combination of technology and information. They need to adopt a new way of thinking and running their business. And it starts with simple things like this,â€ says Ng. Â Â Focus on SMEsâ€™ part of RHBâ€™s [emailÂ protected] plan Â In February, RHB unveiled its five-year plan called [emailÂ protected] It identified small and medium enterprises (SMEs), mid and large-cap companies and the affluent as key segments it wants to grow. The bank aims to increase the contribution of its retail and SME segments to its domestic loan portfolio from the 69% currently to 75% by end-2022. It is currently the fourth largest bank financing SMEs in the country. â€œOur mission is to become the preferred SME bank in Malaysia. In that quest, we aim to be the third in SME market share, contributing 20% of RHBâ€™s assets under our [emailÂ protected],â€ says Jeffrey Ng, RHBâ€™s head of group business and transaction banking. â€œTo give you the background, maybe five years ago, we were a mere No 6. So, we have grown quite significantly over the years and we want to continue growing. Over the next five years, we are going to reach out to a lot more SMEs in the market.â€ He says the SME business has seen a compound annual growth rate of 11% over the last five years. Last year, it grew almost 10% despite financing for the SME sector only growing at 6% in general. RHBâ€™s SME segment was estimated to have 9% market share in this segment last year, compared with 8.7% in 2016. RHB will have to face fierce competition from many banks that are also targeting the SME segment. Some are providing mentorships to SMEs while others are expanding their digital services. Ng says RHBâ€™s strength is that it started on the digitalisation path ahead of the others. â€œWhen we rolled out the e-Retail solution for retailers a couple of years ago, we were the first in the market. Today, they come in and basically have all the solutions ready,â€ he adds. â€œWe are also probably the only commercial banking unit where our relationship managers are equipped digitally to do advisory for customers with the iSmart tool. We will strive to stay ahead of the curve in terms of digital innovation in the commercial banking space.â€ On the other hand, he does not see equity crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending platforms as competitors in the SME market. â€œI view them as complementary to the growth of the whole SME industry, at least for the medium term. For now, they basically fill the gaps that potentially exist in the SME market,â€ says Ng. Internally, the bank has adopted the Agile strategy to speed up the time-to-market of its products. This method gathers people from different disciplines and co-locates them to create customer-centric solutions. â€œWhat is different is that we empower them so they can be self-sufficient with a straightforward governance structure. So, what you get at the end of the day is better collaboration, flexibility and innovation,â€ says Ng. â€œYou have people in risk, credit, compliance, sales and products all sitting together coming up with a solution for your customers. Speed to market has heightened significantly, so you will find that we will be able to roll out products and services quickly.â€', '5/20/2018 3:30', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Financial technology (fintech) could provide the solution, says Kerry Agiasotis, managing director and executive vice-president of Sage Asia Pacific. Payment-related fintech solutions could help drive real efficiencies in cash management and provide insights into a companyâ€™s financial health, says Agiasotis. â€œThe very early interactions were very simple financial and documentary transactions that crossed over business and banking processes.â€ Another way to increase productivity is through the utilisation of a companyâ€™s assets, he adds. â€œFor a small business, cash is king. It is important to make sure it has full visibility of all of its liabilities and obligations and make sure it is making payments and receiving them on time. Basically, working cash is very important.â€ Agiasotis says fintech is influencing this by removing the middlemen and overheads from business-to-business (B2B) financial transactions. â€œI think that is where you are going to see the first wave. And this is where the crossover comes into the application software companies.â€ For a business to manage its resources and cash, it needs to understand exactly what its obligations are. Agiasotis says when a business is making purchases, it needs to know whom it needs to pay and by when. â€œSmall businesses also need to have the visibility of all the cash coming in and all the invoices they are sending out. Those business transactions are recorded in the companyâ€™s core business system, which is typically an accounting system like ours.â€ But the invoices and payments have not been linked in any meaningful way. So, there is no way for the business owner to tell if an invoice has been paid unless he checks his bank account. â€œBut once those things become connected, the business owner will no longer have to check his bank accounts to see if the invoice has been paid. This is a simple example of how efficiency is created in procurement and payment, by the connectivity between business processes and financial services,â€ says Agiasotis. As the whole process gets integrated into the organisationâ€™s core software, other opportunities are created for the companyâ€™s growth, he adds. Â Alternative financing for SMEsâ€™ growth Traditionally, businesses reach out to banks for working capital. And despite knowing very little to nothing about the businesses, the banks determine that the individuals running them are obligated to pay off the loan and lean on their assets until they do, says Agiasotis. â€œThe banks say they are lending to the individuals instead of the businesses because they do not have enough confidence in the businesses due to the lack of visibility. However, these companies can get the visibility from an enterprise software,â€ he points out. â€œIf a company uses this type of software to manage invoices and payments, the health of the business becomes more visible. Historically, this data was locked up because many SMEs did not have access to this software as it was too expensive. But now, with cloudÂ computingÂ [which has brought down prices], it is all available to them.â€ Sage offers its software through a monthly subscription and does away with the need for hardware. All the data sits in cloud servers, making it available to banks and other financial institutions. â€œDue to the increased visibility, the banks would have more confidence to extend funds in a more appropriate way. Financial institutions would not have to give these companies very large facilities that they do not need, or one-off capital or asset-based loans,â€ says Agiasotis. There are, however, â€œmore liquid forms of financingâ€, such as trade and invoice financing, which makes it possible for fintech platforms to provide smaller amounts of capital frequently as they can recycle their capital quickly, he points out.Â SMEs, on the other hand, could develop future plans and source for additional funding easily. Agiasotis cites CapitalBay, which provides an invoice financing platform for Malaysian businesses that can source capital from multiple banks that are willing to finance both suppliers and buyers based on accepted invoices. â€œIt is more feasible for non-banks to get involved in these types of financing because the amount is discreet and short term,â€ he says. On top of that, cloud computing allows service providers to be connected so that information about the companiesâ€™ transactions is available immediately. â€œFinancial institutions can make real-time decisions,â€ says Agiasotis. Â Time for SMEs to leverage fintech solutions The Malaysian market is well placed to benefit from fintech innovation, starting with B2B payments, with the top six banks in the country collaborating with fintech and software companies such as Sage to automate business payment processes, according to Agiasotis. For example, last June, Sage partnered Maybank to provide the bankâ€™s SME customers with access to Sage One â€” a cloud-based accounting solution that allows them to access their accounts via mobile devices. This frees up the SMEs from having to purchase costly accounting software or worrying about the software installations, updates and training, data security and disaster recovery preparation. â€œSuch innovation will drive material financial benefits for all businesses, especially smaller businesses, including getting paid faster and making better use of cash flow, reducing the need for expensive short-term financing instruments and business risk,â€ says Agiasotis. He adds that SMEs need to ensure that they possess the right technology platforms to enable connectivity, and the best example is cloudÂ computing. He says studies have shown that by the end of this year, more than 80% of theÂ Fortune 1000 companies andÂ moreÂ than 50% of very large businesses will be in the cloud. â€œThere will be people who already have a technology strategy or have already made the investments to have part of theirÂ organisationsÂ open to working this way.Â If you think about the traditional supply chain, big businesses depend upon small businesses and vice versa. So,Â when aÂ big business says, â€˜This is how I want to do businessâ€™ or â€˜This is how I want to make paymentsâ€™, it will force small businesses to follow suit,â€ says Agiasotis. The next stage is for SMEs to figure out how they can better connect with their suppliers and customers, he adds. â€œSMEs need to think about the areas thatÂ canÂ be better connected with their ecosystem. Then, it is all about working in collaboration with third parties to drive new outcomes.â€ Â AI shaping fintech trends Agiasotis says there is a huge amount of investment going into theÂ InternetÂ of Things (IoT) andÂ artificialÂ intelligence (AI). â€œAs you have more information, big data will drive different styles ofÂ making decisionsÂ when it comes to credit and risk management,â€ he adds. This will drive financial innovation such as credit products that businesses can access as and when they are needed. Agiasotis cites dynamic financing, which utilises financial and accounting data to extend financial services as needed. Accounting software companies will leverage AI to present data in such a way that other service providers can use it, he says. â€œIf we can provide forecastÂ cash flowÂ forÂ a business, bank or alternative lender, we could do really interesting things with that in terms of making creditÂ decisions.â€ One ofÂ the fintech players Agiasotis has been working with inÂ cross-borderÂ trade is Waves Platform.Â It is an open-source blockchain platform that allows users to launch their own digital tokens. â€œIt is focused on getting smart contracts inÂ the supplyÂ chain and effectively, it will eliminate a lot of overheads, especially for growing businesses. Today, over 70% of all global trade and cross-border transactions have some type of finance associated with it because of inefficiencies, particularly in counterparty risks and cash-flow management,â€ he says. When the inefficiencies are removed, it would make it far more realistic for a Malaysian company to do business abroad. Agiasotis is upbeat about how AI will change how businesses work. As commercial activities become increasingly connected, AI solutions will have access to big data to automate various processes. â€œSo businesses no longer have to go into a system and type in the fact that a sale has been made. They do notÂ have to analyse a whole lot of data to tell their accountants or banking providers about their financial situation as it would already be visible. The providers may even be able to suggest a short-term loan or facilityÂ toÂ be able to help them out,â€ he adds.', '5/21/2018 7:00', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Some believe the government of the day would invariably seek some control over the mainstream media. This raises the question of whether this will lead to a change of ownership in companies such as Media Prima Bhd, Utusan Melayu (M) Bhd and Star Media Group Bhd. The share prices of politically-linked media companies are currently trading at multi-year lows. Year to date,Â the shares of Media Prima have declined 45%, to close at 41.5 sen last Friday. The counter was trading at 38 sen on March 30, its lowest level since 2003. Shares of Utusan Melayu have dropped 36%, to close at its all-time low ofÂ 24 sen last Friday. Meanwhile, shares of Star Media also declined 31% to close at RM1.13 last Friday, its lowest level since 2007. Media Prima, which has the most newspaper titles in the country, would probably draw the most speculation. Umno currently holds a 19.05% stake â€” via Gabungan Kesturi Sdn Bhd and Altima Inc â€” in Media Prima, which operates four free-to-air television networks and six print publications as well as a number of radio stations. Under the former government, Media Prima was ultimately controlled by BN. In fact, group managing director Datuk Kamal Khalid even ran the communications unit in the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office. But a look at Media Primaâ€™s shareholding structure indicates that Umno could be challenged by other substantial shareholders, such as the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) or Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) if there should be any plans to replace the board. The media groupâ€™s latest annual report shows that the EPF is the second largest shareholder with a 13.25% stake, while PNB, AmanahRaya Bhd and AmanahRaya Trustees Bhd collectively hold 20.65% equity interest. Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) or KWAP has 2.07%. State-owned investment funds thus collectively control a 35.97% stake in Media Prima. That would put Umno, which has less than 20% shareholding, in a vulnerable position. At Media Prima Television Networks, Datuk Seri Ashraf Abdullah has already stepped down as group managing editor for news and current affairs. His deputy Datuk Manja Ismail has taken over his duties. Utusan Melayu (M) Bhd is another media group controlled by Umno, which holds a 49.77% stake. The print media group publishes Utusan Malaysia, Mingguan Malaysia and Kosmo!. The second largest shareholder with a 14.76% stake is Nilam Setar (M) Sdn Bhd, the investment vehicle of tycoon Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Albukhary. Syed Mokhtar is perceived to have a close relationship with Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad. This has prompted some to ask if he will become a white knight to revive the group, which is not faring well financially. Will Umno inject fresh capital to sustain the group? According to news reports, Utusan Melayuâ€™s top brass had told employees at a town hall meeting after the 14th general election that it was facing severe financial conditions and might only be able to continue until the year-end. Utusan Melayu has been loss-making for six consecutive years, with accumulated losses amounting to RM71.4 million as at March 31. Notably, four independent, non-executive directors resigned after GE14 as â€œpart of the overall restructuring planâ€, according to the media group. The four were company chairman Tan Sri Mohamad Fatmi Che Salleh, Datuk Seri Tengku Sariffuddin Tengku Ahmad (press secretary to former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak), Jamalul Kiram Mohd Zakaria and Mohd Yusof Abu Othman. Star Media Group Bhd, meanwhile, is 43.03% owned by the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA). Interestingly, PNB, AmanahRaya Bhd and AmanahRaya Trustees Bhd have a collective stake of 18.06% in the group while the EPF has a 8.38% stake, Lembaga Tabung Haji has 5.39% and KWAP, 0.74%. The media group publishes The Star â€” the largest circulated English daily. It also operates Chinese-language radio station 988 as well as dimsum.my, a homegrown all-Asian video-on-demand service. In a nutshell, state-owned investment funds collectively own a 32.57% stake in Star Media. That makes it uncomfortable for MCA if they should disagree with future plans for the media group and decide to act in concert. Star Media is seen as a major source of income, in the form of dividends, for MCA. Press freedom is among the key thrusts of the Pakatan Harapan manifesto. Communications and Multimedia Minister Gobind Singh Deo is expected to table a proposal to abolish the Anti-Fake News Act 2018 at the Dewan Rakyat sitting in June. Against this backdrop, any move by the new government to tighten its grip on the mainstream media is likely to draw flak. Only time will tell if the new political scene will lead to changes in these media groups.', '6/12/2018 8:00', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

So, youâ€™ll probably see some of these corporate actions happening in 2019 as we drive our capital release for the bank for the areas that we deem non-crucial or less capital-accretive,â€ group CEO Datuk Sulaiman Mohd Tahir said at a press conference last Thursday following the release of its financial results for the year ended March 31, 2018 (FY2018). His comments come amid strong market speculation that AMMB is considering a sale of its profitable general insurance business. It holds 51% of AmGeneral Holdings, which fully owns AmGeneral Insurance Bhd, while the remaining 49% stake is held by Australiaâ€™s largest general insurer, Insurance Australia Group Ltd (IAG). Reuters, citing unnamed sources, reported last December that AMMB was considering selling its 51% stake as part of a move to exit non-core businesses and that the insurer could be valued at US$400 million to US$500 million. It said IAG was also likely to divest its stake as part of the sale process. â€œI think AmGeneral is doing well â€¦ [but] it doesnâ€™t mean that if itâ€™s doing well, I cannot look at possible opportunities. Iâ€™m open [to opportunities], but then itâ€™s a question of value and the buyer, and so we will look at that. But then, itâ€™s got to go through a process, and assuming we do have something, we will surely make the necessary announcements as per regulatory requirements,â€ Sulaiman tells The Edge, when asked if the group was looking to sell its stake in AmGeneral. Asked what he considers to be non-core businesses for the group, he says: â€œEverything is core, but the question is how much revenue you can generate [from them] and whether it is in line with our [banking] business or not. Some of the businesses, we feel we donâ€™t know how to manufacture [the products], and so we could leave it to the experts to manufacture and we concentrate on the distributing. So, we will look at that.â€ The general insurance business registered a 45.2% year-on-year increase in profit after tax to RM246 million in FY2018. AMMBâ€™s entire insurance business â€” general, life and takaful â€” accounted for 19% of its earnings in FY2018. To be sure, other banks too have in recent times moved to dispose of non-core banking assets like insurance and fund management to free up capital amid tougher regulatory requirements. CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, for example, has disposed of some assets and in its latest move, trimmed its stakes in two asset management joint ventures with Principal Financial Group last month. The move will see it recognise a gain of about RM920 million and increase its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio by about 15 basis points, subject to final adjustments. It sold a 20% stake in CIMB-Principal Asset Management and a 10% stake in CIMB-Principal Islamic Asset Management. AMMBâ€™s potential move to dispose of some assets comes as the banking group â€” the countryâ€™s sixth largest by assets â€” looks to reshape itself amid a more competitive environment. The group saw FY2018 net profit decline by 14.5% to RM1.13 billion mainly because of two one-off expenses. It incurred a cost of RM146 million relating to its mutual separation scheme that was completed in 4QFY2018. The MSS will result in savings of RM80 million a year going forward. It also incurred a RM47 million retail operational loss. Stripping out exceptional items, its net profit would have come in flat at RM1.2 billion, which was in line with analystsâ€™ expectation. Its CET 1 stood at a decent 11.3%. On a positive note, the group managed to grow its income by 5.7% to RM3.98 million. â€œThatâ€™s good growth, higher than the market â€¦ we think the momentum should continue in FY2019,â€ Sulaiman says. It grew loans by 5.9%, higher than the industry average of about 4.4%. Its asset quality improved, as indicated by its gross impaired loan ratio moving down to 1.7% from 1.77% three months earlier. The groupâ€™s exposure to the oil and gas sector and commercial real estate sector stands at about 2% and 8% of total gross loans respectively. On its exposure to commercial real estate, Sulaiman says: â€œItâ€™s very small, overall. We have small non-performing loan (NPL) legacies which are still there â€¦ they are in the midst of being disposed of. So, when we talk about disposals at the group, it is not just companies but things like NPLs also.â€ Of the mega infrastructure projects that have been called off by the new government, AMMB has only a â€œsmallâ€ exposure to the MRT3 project, he says. Analysts say the group is on the right track to grow and they like its three-year plan to cut RM300 million in costs by FY2020 â€” it has cut RM140 million in the first year â€” but note that earnings going forward may be impacted by normalising provisions. In the past, writebacks on loan loss provisions had boosted its earnings, but these are now waning. AMMBâ€™s stock will also no longer be a FBM KLCI constituent come June 18. â€œWe believe that this will likely cause pressure on its share price in the near term. [But] we expect to revisit the stock after any short-term headwinds to its share price are resolved,â€ says MIDF Research. Bloomberg data shows that of 17 analysts who track the stock, eight have a â€œbuyâ€ call while seven have a â€œholdâ€ and two, a â€œsellâ€. The average 12-month target price for AMMB was RM3.97.

Asia is now home to 27% of the people on the list, second only to North America. Asiaâ€™s ultra-rich are increasingly looking for more complex and global investments as a record number of patriarchs cede control to the next generation. Younger family members whose wealth came from traditional industries such as real estate and natural resources often seek to diversify into biotech and digital businesses, with Silicon Valley of particular interest for those seeking to invest directly, Mahesh said. Last year, Zurich-based UBS secured a private-funds license in China, allowing the investment unit to start managing money for mainland institutional and high-net-worth investors in Asiaâ€™s largest economy. â€œIn Asia, the clients are less advanced in terms of the sophistication of the family offices structures,â€ said Sara Ferrari, head of the Global Family Office. â€œWeâ€™re moving as they are moving.â€ The firm may add to its team of about 100 family-office bankers in the region, Ferrari said. In Europe, by contrast, she said it expects to grow by increasing revenues with existing clients. UBS started the Global Family Office unit about seven years ago to sell the firmâ€™s funds and investment-banking advice to the largest and most active wealth clients, partly to prevent bigger investment banks from siphoning off revenue from billionaire families. It has a strong presence where most of the worldâ€™s wealth is stored â€” in places like Switzerland, Hong Kong and Singapore â€” though it lacks the investment-banking clout of JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Competition is intensifying, with Credit Suisse Group AG tilting toward wealth management and Goldman aiming to add more than 200 private wealth advisers over the next two years. JPMorgan offers its large family-office clients an array of services, from access to direct private equity and real estate deals to M&A and brokerage advice. Invested assets at Global Family Office, which cross-sells equities trading, derivatives and deal advice, have doubled over the past five years to 120 billion Swiss francs (US$121.8 billion). But UBS feels it could do more for family-office clients, which became a renewed target for growth after Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti combined the bankâ€™s disparate wealth management units into one, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. â€˜Under Pressureâ€™ Over the next two to three years, gross margins in wealth management â€œwill continue to be under pressureâ€ Ermotti said at a May 30 investor conference, adding that it would be wishful thinking to expect margins on deposits to return to levels seen before the financial crisis. That means banks canâ€™t rely on revenues from sitting on customer cash â€” even if it amounts to billions of dollars. In the US, thereâ€™s a â€œbig opportunityâ€ for UBS from closer cooperation between the investment bank and wealth management to serve ultra-high net worth and Global Family Office clients, Ermotti said. Family offices have mushroomed in recent years as private wealth surged and more people took an interest in actively managing their affairs, said John Matthews, head of private wealth management and ultra-high net worth for UBS Wealth Management Americas. Newer, more flexible iterations of the traditional model â€” such as family offices that are virtual or manage money pooled from several families â€” mean family offices can make sense for a wider range people. â€œYears ago, you had to have around US$500 million to have a legitimate family office,â€ Matthews said. â€œThat number is going down now, to around US$200 to US$150 million.â€ Outside Help The family-office concept is relatively new in Asia, despite rapid wealth accumulation there. An estimated 17% of the worldâ€™s 5,300 single-family offices are based on the continent, according to Campden Wealth. The nascent market offers banks a chance to get in early when families most need outside help. For clients in North America â€” where almost almost half of family offices are found â€” UBSâ€™s role skews more toward helping established family offices to access different types of investment products across the bank or helping them develop specific strategies around issues like capital preservation or philanthropy. One area of mutual interest for Global Family Office clients is meeting other families. Such connections may yield co-investments or simply offer a chance to swap information on issues unique to the worldâ€™s richest people. When the bank was recently invited to pitch to a US family office in its third generation, competing against rival banks, the request was for a specific mandate in the markets, Matthews said. â€œBut the conversation actually turned to two key elements,â€ he said. â€œCan you make introductions to us to like-minded families in Asia? And the second piece was non-investment issues â€” like trust and estate work, governance. They rewarded us with a fairly large mandate.â€', '6/12/2018 4:00', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Housing finance fell 1.4% in April, the fifth straight monthly drop and the longest stretch of declines since September 2008, when Lehman Brothers Inc. collapsed and a month before the Reserve Bank of Australia slashed its key interest rate by a percentage point. The downturn is most prominent in Sydney where prices slid 4.2% in May from a year earlier, when they were rising at an annual pace of 17%. Sales at auctions â€” a popular way of marketing houses Down Under â€” have slumped to the lowest since early 2016 in Australiaâ€™s biggest city, with only around half of properties successfully selling. A key factor weighing on Sydneyâ€™s market is tighter credit, as regulators force banks to cut back on the riskiest mortgages. Fewer interest-only loans â€” which are cheaper in the early years because borrowers donâ€™t repay principal â€” means Sydney prices are now out of reach for many investors. Chinese buyers, a previous driver of demand, have also receded due to difficulties in moving cash from the mainland. For Australian borrowers, thereâ€™s little prospect of relief for household income as wage growth has stagnated for the past five years. The economyâ€™s private debt-to-income ratio is also at a record 189%, leaving little scope to increase leverage anyway. Meanwhile, high-income owner-occupiers have less borrowing power due to tighter checks on their real spending levels as part of the mortgage approval process. Previously they could rely on benchmarks that were unrealistically low. Market bulls point to Australiaâ€™s population growth and record-low interest rates â€” unchanged at 1.5% for almost two years â€” as reasons to expect a soft landing in the property market. Others suggest the current downturn is only just getting started, noting the decline after 2003 lasted for more than two years.

But you need more than that â€” typically at least 40 times more, or about US$1 billion â€” if you want a ticket into serious deal-making. Yet, on another level, the rich-ification of private equity harks back to another time. This era of extreme wealth and extreme inequality is minting private dynasties that rival public corporations. On Wall Street, many executives expect the billionaire-whisperers, like merchant bankers of old, to accrue even more financial power. Some of the people who tend these family fortunes say privately that bankers can seem irrelevant. They say their success doesnâ€™t hinge on the banks. The worn-out trope â€” this is a new Gilded Age â€” may not be far off. Not since the days of John D. Rockefeller has so much been owned by so few. â€œThis is a new world thatâ€™s been around, basically, forever,â€ said David Dwek, head of private sponsors at Morgan Stanley. â€œThey are an important part of the deal ecosystem.â€ Wealthy families have always been choice clients for bankers. Today, major banks woo billionaires and their family offices much the way they do multinational corporations or deep-pocketed institutional investors. Services range from advising on mergers and acquisitions to arranging financing for portfolio companies to providing counsel on expanding or selling family businesses. Around the globe, bankers are vying for the worldâ€™s hyper-wealthy as never before Granted, investing is a risky business, even for billionaires. The recent implosion of Steinhoff International Holdings NV, for instance, cost the South African tycoon Christo Wiese, the companyâ€™s biggest shareholder, the equivalent of more than US$3 billion in net worth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Banks that lent Wiese money against his stock have lost roughly US$1 billion. Still, with so much money and influence at stake, bankers are pitching hard. Goldman Sachs Group Inc has its own list of 60, counting among its clients the Reimann familyâ€™s JAB Holding Co and the Koch brothersâ€™ investment firm. JPMorgan, in addition to its initial 55, is watching several hundred families that are poised to enter this rarefied realm. Credit Suisse Group AG, which has retreated from wealth management for less-well-heeled customers, reserves its ultimate white-glove treatment for about 200 moneyed individuals and clans. Deutsche Bank AG and UBS Group AG have separate units that bridge private wealth management and investment banking. At Morgan Stanley, Dwekâ€™s team targets â€œpermanent capital,â€ or money from families, sovereign wealth funds, pension systems and listed investment companies. The operation began about eight years ago as part of an effort to pull wealthy families into Morgan Stanleyâ€™s orbit. Over at JPMorgan, bankers in April arranged financing for an acquisition of Texas-based food company C.H. Guenther & Son by PPC Partners. The investment company is controlled by the Pritzker family, one of Americaâ€™s richest clans. Paul Carbone leads PPC with Tony Pritzker, and together they focus on North American companies valued between US$100 million and US$750 million. Carbone, formerly managing partner of the private-equity group at Robert W. Baird & Co, said PPC doesnâ€™t rely on bank-led auctions to source most of its deals. Rather, banks tend to serve as intermediaries and pitch firms such as PPC to business owners looking to sell or expand. The banksâ€™ goal, as he put it: â€œto put people together who have like interests, in a very old-world sort of way.â€ â€œWeâ€™re trying to reach people where theyâ€™re most passionateâ€ Credit Suisse, which has also advised PPC, went as far as to organize an event in Detroit to nurture ties with Daniel Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans Inc, and other super-affluent types. (Gilbert, who co-hosted the event, is worth more than US$7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.) Representatives of 43 families worth a combined US$75 billion attended the May 2017 event. The official topic was revitalizing Detroit. If Credit Suisse drummed up business, so much the better. Credit Suisse was already financing mortgage originations for Quicken Loans. But the bank sees its relationship with Gilbert as valuable even beyond his company, said Charles Buckley, head of ultra-high net worth coverage for North America. â€œWeâ€™re trying to reach people where theyâ€™re most passionate,â€ Buckley said. â€œSometimes thatâ€™s in traditional investment-banking ways, but sometimes itâ€™s not. Sometimes itâ€™s helping them revitalize Detroit.â€ Buckley now oversees a US$3 billion portfolio of loans made chiefly against billionairesâ€™ stakes in private companies, as well as a team of 20 bankers. â€œIt could be a block trade one day, and they may want to tap into public markets another,â€ said Shideh Theunissen, Buckleyâ€™s lieutenant. Itâ€™s almost impossible to put a specific number on the money thatâ€™s at stake. The Pritzkersâ€™ PPC Partners, Paul Allenâ€™s Vulcan and Stone Canyon Industries, backed by Michael Milken, are among the more recognizable names. Many others fly under the radar. And not all billionaires are looking to acquire companies or take stakes in private ventures. Still, activity has been heating up, particularly in middle-market transactions. The value of deals done by family offices jumped to US$100.6 billion in 2016, from US$25.1 billion five years earlier, according to PitchBook data. Private bankers now say that entry-class â€œrichâ€ starts at about US$25 million. But you need more than that if you want a ticket into serious deal-making. Major banks must compete with an established cast of specialized boutiques. Byron Trott, known for his long-term links to Warren Buffett, caters to the worldâ€™s wealthy; his firm, BDT Capital Partners, has used its connections to raise billions for private-equity funds. One of the grand old names in banking, Rothschild & Co, has also been expanding lately, with an eye toward the ultra-rich. It helped the Koch brothers finance Meredith Corpâ€™s takeover of Time Inc last year. Another boutique, Moelis & Co, has won the favor of hedge fund manager-turned-Sears Chief Executive Officer Edward Lampert, as well as casino mogul Steve Wynn. Aryeh Bourkoffâ€™s LionTree Advisors works closely with the tycoon John Malone. Major banks want to bring good deals to family offices, partly to avoid losing business to the boutiques and middle-market investment banks, said Bill Woodson, who leads Citi Private Bankâ€™s family-office group in North America. Woodsonâ€™s unit, with four private bankers and two investment bankers, shepherds large family offices looking to make deals from one area of the bank to another. Bigger banks still are trying to adjust to the new realities. Over the years, even as rich lists exploded, many large global banks became so fragmented that billionaires simply outgrew them and hired their own investment professionals. In the past, many bankers were so focused on corporate clients and other big institutional investors that they largely ignored individual fortunes. Investment bankers might even drop a billionaireâ€™s family office as a client, figuring that pitching deals to it wasnâ€™t worth the hassle. No more. â€œFrom our perspective, theyâ€™re No. 1 or No. 2 on a call list,â€ said Todd Stevens, head of the key client partners business at Deutsche Bank.', '6/12/2018 3:19', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Management focused mainly on the recent acquisition of Genaxis (51% subsidiary) and Innovation Associates Consulting (IAC) (60% subsidiary via Genaxis). According to management, IAC has the edge when it comes to government contracts as it is cheaper but tends to fall short in the private sector given the lack of global experience. Nevertheless, IAC received the contract to implement 1GFMAS (Government Financial and Management Accounting System) valued at RM151.4 million for three years. Besides that, Genaxis has a current order book of RM20 million, and is aggressively bidding for other contracts in the public and private sectors. We believe DNeXâ€™s position as a government service provider is enhanced by the acquisition of the two consulting firms. Management revealed that 30%-owned Ping Petroleum is diversifying its asset base. We understand that Ping will begin development of its Avalon greenfield located in the North Sea, offshore Ireland. Additionally, the group is bidding for additional exploration fields in the North Sea. Furthermore, Ping has begun bidding for an additional brownfield similar to Anasuria after losing the bid for a similar brownfield asset last year. Despite the large expected capital expenditure required, DNeX intends to request Ping to pay out dividends, given strong cash flows from the Anasuria operations. Note that Anasuriaâ€™s cash flows are directly linked to crude oil price, and oil production is expected to increase after the maintenance activities carried out in financial year 2017 (FY17). DNeX announced that it would provide connectivity between the existing vehicle entry permit (VEP) system and TnG. The contract is expected to generate revenue of RM19 million to RM21 million per annum with a gross profit margin of around 35%. We understand that the RFID tag is currently encrypted on foreign vehicles entering Malaysia. However, going forward, we believe the goal is to equip all local vehicles with the RFID tag and collect toll payments via RFID. Additionally, DNeX is the sole supplier for this service in Malaysia given its link to the VEP. That said, the new governmentâ€™s promise to abolish tolls may result in some downside risk. On the other hand, management revealed that the subcontract via Bukti Megah to rehire foreign workers has ended. OGPC Sdn Bhd secured a contract to supply portable container systems (PCS) to Petro Teguh last year. Management noted that delivery is way behind schedule and shared that only seven systems were delivered in FY17 whilst one was delivered in the first quarter of FY18. It still expects to deliver around 50 units in FY18 and the remainder in FY19. We note that a contract tenure extension is likely, given the delays on-site. DNeX revealed that the delays were mainly due to on-site dealers taking longer than expected to meet regulatory requirements. DNeX is working closely with Petro Teguh to rectify the problems at the various installation sites. Note that DNeXâ€™s task under the contract is only to supply the PCS. Therefore, we believe that DNeX will not incur any penalties for the delays. DNeXâ€™s long-term outlook seems secure on the back of its Sealnet (previously known as 1Trade) trade facilitation system and development of Avalon field by Ping Petroleum. â€” TA Securities Research, June 11', '6/12/2018 3:00', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The three-month â€œtax-freeâ€ period will no doubt be a boost to short-term earnings, but it does not address the structural problems facing the industry. We believe BTotoâ€™s revenue was cut by 2% under the previous GST regime, as the company absorbed the cost instead of passing this on to its customers. The impact on BToto to its bottom line was more significant at around -20% a year. However, we are of the view that the new SST regime could still expand to include number forecast operators (NFOs), as they contributed around RM150 million in GST based on our estimates, and this inclusion would also not have any direct impact on consumers. Hence, the higher profitability is only likely to last for the three months (June to August) before the SST is reintroduced in September. The decline in NFOsâ€™ revenue is a structural problem due to the more attractive payouts from illegal operators, and we believe the zero-rated GST will be help resolve the problem. We believe that operators could have tweaked the payout to pass on the impact of the GST, but the widening of the current payout difference (against illegal operators), at around 28%, could cause a significant dip in revenue. Unless there is a step-up in enforcement, or an increase in payout (which we think is unlikely for now), the problem is likely to persist, in which case the NFOs might not be able to enjoy the full benefit of the improving consumer sentiment. As we are not expecting the benefits from the tax holiday to last beyond the three-month period, we are keeping our dividend discount model-based TP unchanged at RM2.20, but downgrading our call to â€œsellâ€ from â€œholdâ€ due to the recent run-up in share price post the announcement. Upside risks include the no further taxes implemented on BToto and increased enforcement against illegal betting operators. â€” Affin Hwang Capital Research, June 11', '6/12/2018 2:56', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Lower catch rates led to higher imports required to support surimi production. As weather conditions are showing meaningful improvement, management is hopeful for better fishing yields that could return margins to healthier levels. This could be further supported by the recently commissioned new surimi plants in Hutan Melintang. In FY17, PBT margins registered at 16.7% as opposed to 13.7% in FY18. With the coming 2020 Tokyo Olympics, management mulls potential collaborations to support an anticipated surge in demand there, which could boost FY20. With its around 60% prime age profile, management is hopeful for an around 15% growth in the fresh fruit bunch (FFB) yields. In the medium term, around 30% of the plantation portfolio which is of a younger age category is poised to contribute further to FFB output. Management anticipates crude palm oil prices to trail between RM2,350 per tonne and RM2,450 per tonne for FY19. This is in line with our in-house expectation of RM2,400 per tonne on average for 2018. The egg market in Peninsular Malaysia is overcrowded as egg producers continue to scale up production. In the integrated livestock farming recent results, its Indonesian performance was dampened by poorer broiler contributions. Going forward, management expects its other markets (that is, Sabah and Sarawak, and Vietnam) to remain stable. Hence, the expanded Vietnam poultry layer unit and feed mills are expected to contribute favourably to the group. On the latest count, FamilyMart has opened 49 new stores, on track with FY18â€™s target. Management earmarks to open another 50 stores in FY19 towards their FY22 target of 300 stores. While operations are not expected to break even in FY19, management expects the store chain to become profitable in FY20 from an expected store base of around 120 branches. We continue to remain optimistic about the delivery of top-line growth amid challenges in certain sectors. This is partly thanks to the groupâ€™s well-diversified base and regional exposure. While heavy investments are geared mainly for longer-term gain under its five-year plan, the groupâ€™s market leading position should keep the company relevant amid a highly competitive landscape. However, we leave our assumptions unchanged as we believe the above-mentioned merits have been sufficiently accounted for in our estimates. Our valuation is based on an unchanged 29 times FY19 price-earning ratio. The ascribed valuation is in line with the groupâ€™s three-year mean, following a strong buying rally across the consumer space. While the group has strong fundamentals, we believe most of the positives may be already priced into its rich valuations. Furthermore, the low dividend prospects may cause yield-seeking investors to look elsewhere. Risks to our call include significant improvement to MPM sales, a significant uptick in palm oil prices and sales volume, and better-than-expected demand of poultry products abroad. â€” Kenanga Research, June 11', '6/12/2018 2:57', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Operational since 2009 and strategically located near the international shipping lanes in the vicinity of Singapore, the two terminals have a total storage capacity of 647,000 cubic metres (cu m) and are currently fully utilised on term contracts.Â Â Dialog also wholly owns the equity interests in Langsat Terminal (Three) Sdn Bhd (LGT 3), which acquired two parcels of lease land and a 100,000 cu m tank terminal in Tanjung Langsat, Johor, in March 2018 for further capacity expansion.

As the increase will be insignificant to the group, our forecasts are unchanged for now. Meanwhile, the main valuation rerating catalyst for the group stems from its Pengerang Deepwater Terminal (PDT) project.

Â Earlier this year, the group signed a memorandum of understanding with the Johor state government to develop PDT Phase 3. Dialog trades at an FY19 PER of 36 times, below its five-year peak of 46 times. We view its higher-than-peer premium as justified given Dialogâ€™s long-term recurring cash flow-generating businesses, which are largely cushioned from volatile crude oil price cycles, and further underpinned by the Pengerang developmentâ€™s multi-year value rerating bonanza together with a healthy balance sheet. â€” AmImvestment Bank, June 11', '6/12/2018 2:58', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

In comparison, a similar research done by Nielsen in 2015 found that attitudes towards the GST introduction were less optimistic, with over half of Malaysians (58%) then believing the tax would be good for the economy. â€œWhile Malaysians were initially tentative towards the introduction of the GST three years ago when the tax was first announced, having experienced the effects of the GST over the past three years, they appear to welcome the move to effectively eliminate the tax, perhaps due to the gradual increase in the cost of goods and services that has occurred since its implementation as reflected in the Consumer Price Index,â€ said Nielsen Malaysia managing director Raphael Pereda in a statement. The survey showed that over half of consumers (57%) expect the prices of goods and services to decrease following the â€œzerorisationâ€ of the GST, while one-third (33%) believe that prices will remain at current levels. According to Pereda, this may mean consumer spending intentions will rise, which could result in increased sales for manufacturers and retailers. The data showed that two out of three consumers (69%) expect their purchase habits to change following the GST reduction, with close to one-third (30%) saying that they would spend more money on essential items, such as apparel and clothing, perishable foods, non-perishable foods and baby products. The survey also showed Malaysiansâ€™ willingness to increase their spending on non-essential purchases such as holidays or leisure trips (33%), new property (27%) and out-of-home entertainment (26%). One in four consumers (25%) said they will be able to channel their money towards paying off debts with the zero-rating of the GST. â€œMany retailers had been providing consumers with discounts even before the zero-rated GST was officially implemented to encourage consumers not to postpone their festive spending to after June 1, 2018. â€œIf these value-for-money promotions continue, we can expect to see an increase in sales volume compared with previous years,â€ said Pereda. The Nielsen survey also showed that 77% of the respondents view the governmentâ€™s initiative to fix the price of fuel as being â€œgood for consumersâ€, while an overwhelming nine out of 10 believe that tolls would either be removed or reduced. â€œIt is clear that the recent policy announcements made by the government have gained the approval of a vast majority of Malaysians.

To recap, Pharmaniaga has held exclusive rights since 1994 under a concession agreement (CA) to purchase a list of medical products under the MoHâ€™s approved product purchase list (APPL) from suppliers selected by the MoH, and distribute them to medical institutions under the MoHâ€™s jurisdiction. Under the CA, Pharmaniaga procures medical products at prices which have been predetermined by the MoH with its suppliers. It sells these products to the MoH at a fixed percentage markup over its purchase prices to cover its cost of inventory holding, distribution and potential inventory obsolescence. The CA was last renewed in 2009 for a period of 10 years, which will expire by November 2019. Through a tender exercise (every three years), the MoH selects the suppliers of products for the APPL based on its own product specifications and criteria. While Pharmaniaga does organise these tender exercises under the CA, we understand that it does not play any part in the selection of suppliers by the MoH. Pharmaniagaâ€™s own manufacturing segment also participates in these tenders. As of financial year 2017 (FY17), revenue from the CA made up 49% of Pharmaniagaâ€™s revenue, and was fully reflected under the logistics and distribution (L&D) segment (68.3% of FY17 revenue). In our view, margins for the CA business are thin given that the earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) margin for the overall L&D segment was 1.2% in FY17. Note that the L&D divisionâ€™s FY17 Ebit only made up 17.7% of the groupâ€™s total FY17 Ebit, with the remainder generated by its manufacturing segment (69.3%) and Indonesia operations (13%). According to media reports, the MoHâ€™s budget for medical products was at around RM3.3 billion in the L&D segment (68.3% of FY17 revenue). We estimate that only 33.4% of the MoHâ€™s budget was used for the purchase of medical products under the APPL given that Pharmaniaga is the sole supplier under the CA. We believe the remaining budget of RM2.2 billion was used to purchase drugs which fall out of the APPL list, likely through central contracts and direct purchases. Overall, we maintain our earnings estimates, â€œaddâ€ call and 12-month TP of RM4.55. This is still based on 15.9 times calendar year 2019 price-earnings ratio, a 10% discount to CIMBâ€™s pharmaceutical sector five-year target mean. Its dividend yields of 5.4% to 7.2% (FY18 to FY20) should also appeal to investors. Downside risks include lower-than-expected demand for drugs from the MoH and discontinuation of the CA. â€” CGSCIMB Research, June 11', '6/12/2018 2:53', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Meanwhile, the Natural Gas Index declined by 0.4% and the electricity output grew by 5.8% in April 2018 after recording an increase of 4.4% in March 2018. Overall, Nomura Global Markets Research, in a note yesterday, said the pickup in April IPI growth is consistent with its view that second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth will likely be supported by government spending around the general election, the return of fuel subsidies and the zero-rating of the goods and services tax (GST) in June. Looking into the third quarter, Nomura said that the boost to private consumption is likely to be modest and is unlikely to offset the hit to growth from significant government spending cuts to offset the loss in GST revenue. In a note yesterday, CIMB Research said the manufacturing recovery in Malaysia in April was broadly in line with the rebound regionally, including in Singapore, Thailand and South Korea. However, the positive external momentum that has underpinned growth in the manufacturing sector thus far, is expected to weaken, as demand from major economies and global electronics cycle normalises. â€œMoreover, we expect the governmentâ€™s cost rationalisation drive through operating expenditure cuts and cancellation of infrastructure projects to dampen investment growth, offsetting the expansionary effects on household spending from the goods and services tax (GST) cut, fuel subsidies and welfare transfers,â€ said CIMB Research, hence, maintaining its 2018 GDP growth forecast at 5.2%, below the Bloomberg consensus of 5.5%. Going forward, MIDF Research foresees IPI performances to expand at steady pace for the second half of 2018 amid escalating trade tension, moderating inflation and supportive policy changes for businesses such as zero-rated GST and stabilised retail fuel prices. Plus, MIDF Research expects the encouraging IPI growth trend in 2017 to continue in 2018 supported by robust external trade performance and gradual increase in commodity price to boost up the industrial activity in Malaysia. Brent crude oil price average at US$76.70 (RM306.03), up by 49.2% y-o-y in May, said MIDF Research, noting that the strong rise in commodity prices is due to strengthening global demand and continuous efforts of oil production limit among most oil-producing countries. â€œLower business cost partly due to moderating inflation, stable retail fuel prices and zero-rated GST will provide additional supports for industrial production growth to hit 4.3% in 2018,â€ said MIDF Research, in a note yesterday.

Through the online platform, RHB targets to approve RM100 million in SME loans over the course of one year. Yesterday, RHB launched its pilot run focusing on SMEs in the Klang Valley. It will introduce the platform nationwide by the third quarter of this year. The RHB SME Financing offers SME term loans with a minimum tenure of six months up to 24 months, for disbursements of between RM50,000 and RM300,000. It is eligible for businesses with an annual turnover of less than RM35 million. The online loan application only requires two documents to be uploaded, and it provides a loan simulator to help customers calculate their affordability. Application tracking can also be done via the platform. â€œOne thing that SMEs are looking for is simplicity. They find that banks are a bit complicated; they are unsure of how to do the submission and they donâ€™t have clarity as to where exactly are their applications. So with this platform, we are trying to address that gap. We reduce document requirements and we also tell them exactly at which point is their application process,â€ Ng added. Ng said Malaysia has about 900,000 SMEs, and close to 20% of that have some form of relationship with RHB, giving the bank an SME loan market share of 9% as of 2017. â€œThe SME market itself has a lot of depth and is still underpenetrated so there is still room to grow for the banking industry.

Adam said foreign attrition last Tuesday narrowed further to RM87.6 million net following the technology rally on Wall Street overnight. Though the FBM KLCI surged by 1.25% to 1,777 points last Wednesday, spurred by the Nasdaq index booking a third record high during the week, foreign selling inched higher to RM134.2 million net on the same day, Adam noted, amid the announcement of populist policies by Italyâ€™s new government in the wake of the European Central Bankâ€™s plan to end its quantitative easing programme. â€œThe level of attrition thereafter swelled to near the RM300 million net level on (last) Thursday and (last) Friday as investors geared up for the G7 (Group of Seven) meeting, where a risk of trade war was renewed with France and Canada threatening retaliatory duties in response to US levies. â€œLast weekâ€™s abating outflows brought the year-to-date (YTD) outflow from Malaysia to US$757.6 million net or RM3.02 billion net,â€ he said. Adam said this is still the lowest among its Asean peers that MIDF Research monitors, namely Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia.

Investors can get to see among others, people who work in risk departments at banks, who can tell them how theyâ€™re classifying loans, he said.

Investors have been rattled by a lack of corporate financial transparency as rising funding costs from a deleveraging campaign spur a surge in defaults.

Industry coalition Padi Rescue coordinator Norfitri Amir Muhammad said trust and transparency could be reinstated with the revival of the National Rice and Paddy Board (LPN) that can establish a fund from the profit earned from rice imports to help farmers. â€œAs it stands, our study shows that monopoly holder Padiberas Nasional Bhd (Bernas) earns a profit margin of RM700 per tonne from the imported rice. Imagine what their profit must be like? â€œIf the LPN is revived with the participation of farmers, it will be an independent body made up by people who know the sector. Profit from imports [of rice] could go into the fund to help the sector in emergencies like disease-ridden plants and floods,â€ he told a media conference yesterday. Norfitri said the problem cannot be solved with just the appointment of a group of companies handling the imports because it does not resolve the low demand for local rice. â€œFarmers donâ€™t have the bargaining power to ask for good prices. This sector is not one that should be seen as a profit-making sector. The subsidy for padi is about RM2.2 billion but who benefits? â€œThe contract holders for fertilisers or insecticides mark up the prices. The government must review these contracts because it [can] save money here. So we should not be looking at Bernas only but at every level, hence the need for the LPN (which was first set up in the 1970s),â€ he added. Last week, Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Minister Salahuddin Ayub announced the termination of tycoon Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhariâ€™s Bernasâ€™ rice import monopoly. Bernas took over from the LPN in 1996 and was listed a year later on Bursa Malaysia before it was taken private. In 2011, its concession to import rice was extended for another 10 years until 2021. However, as part of the Pakatan Harapan governmentâ€™s manifesto to break Bernasâ€™ monopoly, a working paper with ministry feedback and other stakeholders is being drafted to be submitted to the government for further action. According to a study by the Malay Economic Action Council (MTEM), an umbrella body representing 47 Malay non-governmental organisations, local rice farmers milled 1.82 billion tonnes of rice last year, and up to 900,000 tonnes of rice were imported by Bernas, mostly from Vietnam, to meet the shortfall of 2.75 billion tonnes for consumption in Malaysia. Malaysia imports 30% of rice. Norfitri said Malaysian farmers are able to make up to 100% of local demand but due to bad management of the industry, including weak seeds because of a lack of research and development, and high costs of fertilisers and insecticides. Padi Rescue is an organisation of farmers under the MTEM. Local farmer Azhar Hashim, 50, said a government subsidy of RM2,000 per hectare is high, but farmers still experience losses because of alleged discrepancies in the sector like the sale of insecticides at RM90 a bottle compared with RM40 in countries like Thailand.', '6/12/2018 2:19', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Asia is now home to 27% of the people on the list, second only to North America. Asiaâ€™s ultra-rich are increasingly looking for more complex and global investments as a record number of patriarchs cede control to the next generation. Younger family members whose wealth came from traditional industries such as real estate and natural resources often seek to diversify into biotech and digital businesses, with Silicon Valley of particular interest for those seeking to invest directly, Mahesh said. Last year, Zurich-based UBS secured a private-funds license in China, allowing the investment unit to start managing money for mainland institutional and high-net-worth investors in Asiaâ€™s largest economy. â€œIn Asia, the clients are less advanced in terms of the sophistication of the family offices structures,â€ said Sara Ferrari, head of the Global Family Office. â€œWeâ€™re moving as they are moving.â€ The firm may add to its team of about 100 family-office bankers in the region, Ferrari said. In Europe, by contrast, she said it expects to grow by increasing revenues with existing clients. UBS started the Global Family Office unit about seven years ago to sell the firmâ€™s funds and investment-banking advice to the largest and most active wealth clients, partly to prevent bigger investment banks from siphoning off revenue from billionaire families. It has a strong presence where most of the worldâ€™s wealth is stored â€” in places like Switzerland, Hong Kong and Singapore â€” though it lacks the investment-banking clout of JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Competition is intensifying, with Credit Suisse Group AG tilting toward wealth management and Goldman aiming to add more than 200 private wealth advisers over the next two years. JPMorgan offers its large family-office clients an array of services, from access to direct private equity and real estate deals to M&A and brokerage advice. Invested assets at Global Family Office, which cross-sells equities trading, derivatives and deal advice, have doubled over the past five years to 120 billion Swiss francs (US$121.8 billion). But UBS feels it could do more for family-office clients, which became a renewed target for growth after Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti combined the bankâ€™s disparate wealth management units into one, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. â€˜Under Pressureâ€™ Over the next two to three years, gross margins in wealth management â€œwill continue to be under pressureâ€ Ermotti said at a May 30 investor conference, adding that it would be wishful thinking to expect margins on deposits to return to levels seen before the financial crisis. That means banks canâ€™t rely on revenues from sitting on customer cash â€” even if it amounts to billions of dollars. In the US, thereâ€™s a â€œbig opportunityâ€ for UBS from closer cooperation between the investment bank and wealth management to serve ultra-high net worth and Global Family Office clients, Ermotti said. Family offices have mushroomed in recent years as private wealth surged and more people took an interest in actively managing their affairs, said John Matthews, head of private wealth management and ultra-high net worth for UBS Wealth Management Americas. Newer, more flexible iterations of the traditional model â€” such as family offices that are virtual or manage money pooled from several families â€” mean family offices can make sense for a wider range people. â€œYears ago, you had to have around US$500 million to have a legitimate family office,â€ Matthews said. â€œThat number is going down now, to around US$200 to US$150 million.â€ Outside Help The family-office concept is relatively new in Asia, despite rapid wealth accumulation there. An estimated 17% of the worldâ€™s 5,300 single-family offices are based on the continent, according to Campden Wealth. The nascent market offers banks a chance to get in early when families most need outside help. For clients in North America â€” where almost almost half of family offices are found â€” UBSâ€™s role skews more toward helping established family offices to access different types of investment products across the bank or helping them develop specific strategies around issues like capital preservation or philanthropy. One area of mutual interest for Global Family Office clients is meeting other families. Such connections may yield co-investments or simply offer a chance to swap information on issues unique to the worldâ€™s richest people. When the bank was recently invited to pitch to a US family office in its third generation, competing against rival banks, the request was for a specific mandate in the markets, Matthews said. â€œBut the conversation actually turned to two key elements,â€ he said. â€œCan you make introductions to us to like-minded families in Asia? And the second piece was non-investment issues â€” like trust and estate work, governance. They rewarded us with a fairly large mandate.â€', '6/12/2018 4:00', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Housing finance fell 1.4% in April, the fifth straight monthly drop and the longest stretch of declines since September 2008, when Lehman Brothers Inc. collapsed and a month before the Reserve Bank of Australia slashed its key interest rate by a percentage point. The downturn is most prominent in Sydney where prices slid 4.2% in May from a year earlier, when they were rising at an annual pace of 17%. Sales at auctions â€” a popular way of marketing houses Down Under â€” have slumped to the lowest since early 2016 in Australiaâ€™s biggest city, with only around half of properties successfully selling. A key factor weighing on Sydneyâ€™s market is tighter credit, as regulators force banks to cut back on the riskiest mortgages. Fewer interest-only loans â€” which are cheaper in the early years because borrowers donâ€™t repay principal â€” means Sydney prices are now out of reach for many investors. Chinese buyers, a previous driver of demand, have also receded due to difficulties in moving cash from the mainland. For Australian borrowers, thereâ€™s little prospect of relief for household income as wage growth has stagnated for the past five years. The economyâ€™s private debt-to-income ratio is also at a record 189%, leaving little scope to increase leverage anyway. Meanwhile, high-income owner-occupiers have less borrowing power due to tighter checks on their real spending levels as part of the mortgage approval process. Previously they could rely on benchmarks that were unrealistically low. Market bulls point to Australiaâ€™s population growth and record-low interest rates â€” unchanged at 1.5% for almost two years â€” as reasons to expect a soft landing in the property market.

Today, in an age of affluence not even the Astors and Vanderbilts might have imagined, there is something closer to a List of 55. Its members are so rich that, in rarefied corners of Wall Street, they seem less like actual people than vast investment empires. Their ranks include familiar names like Bezos and Dell, as well as a growing number of lesser lights whose dynastic wealth is reshaping global business, if not capitalism itself. This unofficial list represents the first, rough cut of the most sought-after banking clients at JPMorgan Chase & Co, and it is by no means complete. To the contrary: The List of 55 is only the beginning. Around the globe, bankers are vying for the worldâ€™s hyper-wealthy as never before. And they are holding out investments that are tantalizingly off-limits to the rest of us, behind a velvet rope of bespoke investment banking. This is how the super-rich keep getting super-richer. Anyone can buy stocks. Only a privileged few can bankroll multimillion-dollar ventures or buy entire companies. Private equity â€” that lucrative and, at times, controversial force of modern finance â€” has become a playground of the new aristocracy. It was bound to happen. Like so many things, investing is becoming increasingly stratified. Private bankers now say that entry-class â€œrichâ€ starts at about US$25 million. But you need more than that â€” typically at least 40 times more, or about US$1 billion â€” if you want a ticket into serious deal-making. Yet, on another level, the rich-ification of private equity harks back to another time. This era of extreme wealth and extreme inequality is minting private dynasties that rival public corporations. On Wall Street, many executives expect the billionaire-whisperers, like merchant bankers of old, to accrue even more financial power. Some of the people who tend these family fortunes say privately that bankers can seem irrelevant. They say their success doesnâ€™t hinge on the banks. The worn-out trope â€” this is a new Gilded Age â€” may not be far off. Not since the days of John D. Rockefeller has so much been owned by so few. â€œThis is a new world thatâ€™s been around, basically, forever,â€ said David Dwek, head of private sponsors at Morgan Stanley. â€œThey are an important part of the deal ecosystem.â€ Wealthy families have always been choice clients for bankers. Today, major banks woo billionaires and their family offices much the way they do multinational corporations or deep-pocketed institutional investors. Services range from advising on mergers and acquisitions to arranging financing for portfolio companies to providing counsel on expanding or selling family businesses. Around the globe, bankers are vying for the worldâ€™s hyper-wealthy as never before Granted, investing is a risky business, even for billionaires. The recent implosion of Steinhoff International Holdings NV, for instance, cost the South African tycoon Christo Wiese, the companyâ€™s biggest shareholder, the equivalent of more than US$3 billion in net worth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Banks that lent Wiese money against his stock have lost roughly US$1 billion. Still, with so much money and influence at stake, bankers are pitching hard. Goldman Sachs Group Inc has its own list of 60, counting among its clients the Reimann familyâ€™s JAB Holding Co and the Koch brothersâ€™ investment firm. JPMorgan, in addition to its initial 55, is watching several hundred families that are poised to enter this rarefied realm. Credit Suisse Group AG, which has retreated from wealth management for less-well-heeled customers, reserves its ultimate white-glove treatment for about 200 moneyed individuals and clans. Deutsche Bank AG and UBS Group AG have separate units that bridge private wealth management and investment banking. At Morgan Stanley, Dwekâ€™s team targets â€œpermanent capital,â€ or money from families, sovereign wealth funds, pension systems and listed investment companies. The operation began about eight years ago as part of an effort to pull wealthy families into Morgan Stanleyâ€™s orbit. Over at JPMorgan, bankers in April arranged financing for an acquisition of Texas-based food company C.H. Guenther & Son by PPC Partners. The investment company is controlled by the Pritzker family, one of Americaâ€™s richest clans. Paul Carbone leads PPC with Tony Pritzker, and together they focus on North American companies valued between US$100 million and US$750 million. Carbone, formerly managing partner of the private-equity group at Robert W. Baird & Co, said PPC doesnâ€™t rely on bank-led auctions to source most of its deals. Rather, banks tend to serve as intermediaries and pitch firms such as PPC to business owners looking to sell or expand. The banksâ€™ goal, as he put it: â€œto put people together who have like interests, in a very old-world sort of way.â€ â€œWeâ€™re trying to reach people where theyâ€™re most passionateâ€ Credit Suisse, which has also advised PPC, went as far as to organize an event in Detroit to nurture ties with Daniel Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans Inc, and other super-affluent types. (Gilbert, who co-hosted the event, is worth more than US$7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.) Representatives of 43 families worth a combined US$75 billion attended the May 2017 event. The official topic was revitalizing Detroit. If Credit Suisse drummed up business, so much the better. Credit Suisse was already financing mortgage originations for Quicken Loans. But the bank sees its relationship with Gilbert as valuable even beyond his company, said Charles Buckley, head of ultra-high net worth coverage for North America. â€œWeâ€™re trying to reach people where theyâ€™re most passionate,â€ Buckley said. â€œSometimes thatâ€™s in traditional investment-banking ways, but sometimes itâ€™s not. Sometimes itâ€™s helping them revitalize Detroit.â€ Buckley now oversees a US$3 billion portfolio of loans made chiefly against billionairesâ€™ stakes in private companies, as well as a team of 20 bankers. â€œIt could be a block trade one day, and they may want to tap into public markets another,â€ said Shideh Theunissen, Buckleyâ€™s lieutenant. Itâ€™s almost impossible to put a specific number on the money thatâ€™s at stake. The Pritzkersâ€™ PPC Partners, Paul Allenâ€™s Vulcan and Stone Canyon Industries, backed by Michael Milken, are among the more recognizable names. Many others fly under the radar. And not all billionaires are looking to acquire companies or take stakes in private ventures. Still, activity has been heating up, particularly in middle-market transactions. The value of deals done by family offices jumped to US$100.6 billion in 2016, from US$25.1 billion five years earlier, according to PitchBook data. Private bankers now say that entry-class â€œrichâ€ starts at about US$25 million. But you need more than that if you want a ticket into serious deal-making. Major banks must compete with an established cast of specialized boutiques. Byron Trott, known for his long-term links to Warren Buffett, caters to the worldâ€™s wealthy; his firm, BDT Capital Partners, has used its connections to raise billions for private-equity funds. One of the grand old names in banking, Rothschild & Co, has also been expanding lately, with an eye toward the ultra-rich. It helped the Koch brothers finance Meredith Corpâ€™s takeover of Time Inc last year. Another boutique, Moelis & Co, has won the favor of hedge fund manager-turned-Sears Chief Executive Officer Edward Lampert, as well as casino mogul Steve Wynn. Aryeh Bourkoffâ€™s LionTree Advisors works closely with the tycoon John Malone. Major banks want to bring good deals to family offices, partly to avoid losing business to the boutiques and middle-market investment banks, said Bill Woodson, who leads Citi Private Bankâ€™s family-office group in North America. Woodsonâ€™s unit, with four private bankers and two investment bankers, shepherds large family offices looking to make deals from one area of the bank to another. Bigger banks still are trying to adjust to the new realities. Over the years, even as rich lists exploded, many large global banks became so fragmented that billionaires simply outgrew them and hired their own investment professionals. In the past, many bankers were so focused on corporate clients and other big institutional investors that they largely ignored individual fortunes. Investment bankers might even drop a billionaireâ€™s family office as a client, figuring that pitching deals to it wasnâ€™t worth the hassle. No more. â€œFrom our perspective, theyâ€™re No. 1 or No. 2 on a call list,â€ said Todd Stevens, head of the key client partners business at Deutsche Bank.', '6/12/2018 3:19', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Management focused mainly on the recent acquisition of Genaxis (51% subsidiary) and Innovation Associates Consulting (IAC) (60% subsidiary via Genaxis). According to management, IAC has the edge when it comes to government contracts as it is cheaper but tends to fall short in the private sector given the lack of global experience. Nevertheless, IAC received the contract to implement 1GFMAS (Government Financial and Management Accounting System) valued at RM151.4 million for three years. Besides that, Genaxis has a current order book of RM20 million, and is aggressively bidding for other contracts in the public and private sectors. We believe DNeXâ€™s position as a government service provider is enhanced by the acquisition of the two consulting firms. Management revealed that 30%-owned Ping Petroleum is diversifying its asset base. We understand that Ping will begin development of its Avalon greenfield located in the North Sea, offshore Ireland. Additionally, the group is bidding for additional exploration fields in the North Sea. Furthermore, Ping has begun bidding for an additional brownfield similar to Anasuria after losing the bid for a similar brownfield asset last year. Despite the large expected capital expenditure required, DNeX intends to request Ping to pay out dividends, given strong cash flows from the Anasuria operations. Note that Anasuriaâ€™s cash flows are directly linked to crude oil price, and oil production is expected to increase after the maintenance activities carried out in financial year 2017 (FY17). DNeX announced that it would provide connectivity between the existing vehicle entry permit (VEP) system and TnG. The contract is expected to generate revenue of RM19 million to RM21 million per annum with a gross profit margin of around 35%. We understand that the RFID tag is currently encrypted on foreign vehicles entering Malaysia. However, going forward, we believe the goal is to equip all local vehicles with the RFID tag and collect toll payments via RFID. Additionally, DNeX is the sole supplier for this service in Malaysia given its link to the VEP. That said, the new governmentâ€™s promise to abolish tolls may result in some downside risk. On the other hand, management revealed that the subcontract via Bukti Megah to rehire foreign workers has ended. OGPC Sdn Bhd secured a contract to supply portable container systems (PCS) to Petro Teguh last year. Management noted that delivery is way behind schedule and shared that only seven systems were delivered in FY17 whilst one was delivered in the first quarter of FY18. It still expects to deliver around 50 units in FY18 and the remainder in FY19. We note that a contract tenure extension is likely, given the delays on-site. DNeX revealed that the delays were mainly due to on-site dealers taking longer than expected to meet regulatory requirements. DNeX is working closely with Petro Teguh to rectify the problems at the various installation sites. Note that DNeXâ€™s task under the contract is only to supply the PCS. Therefore, we believe that DNeX will not incur any penalties for the delays. DNeXâ€™s long-term outlook seems secure on the back of its Sealnet (previously known as 1Trade) trade facilitation system and development of Avalon field by Ping Petroleum. â€” TA Securities Research, June 11', '6/12/2018 3:00', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The three-month â€œtax-freeâ€ period will no doubt be a boost to short-term earnings, but it does not address the structural problems facing the industry. We believe BTotoâ€™s revenue was cut by 2% under the previous GST regime, as the company absorbed the cost instead of passing this on to its customers. The impact on BToto to its bottom line was more significant at around -20% a year. However, we are of the view that the new SST regime could still expand to include number forecast operators (NFOs), as they contributed around RM150 million in GST based on our estimates, and this inclusion would also not have any direct impact on consumers. Hence, the higher profitability is only likely to last for the three months (June to August) before the SST is reintroduced in September. The decline in NFOsâ€™ revenue is a structural problem due to the more attractive payouts from illegal operators, and we believe the zero-rated GST will be help resolve the problem. We believe that operators could have tweaked the payout to pass on the impact of the GST, but the widening of the current payout difference (against illegal operators), at around 28%, could cause a significant dip in revenue. Unless there is a step-up in enforcement, or an increase in payout (which we think is unlikely for now), the problem is likely to persist, in which case the NFOs might not be able to enjoy the full benefit of the improving consumer sentiment. As we are not expecting the benefits from the tax holiday to last beyond the three-month period, we are keeping our dividend discount model-based TP unchanged at RM2.20, but downgrading our call to â€œsellâ€ from â€œholdâ€ due to the recent run-up in share price post the announcement. Upside risks include the no further taxes implemented on BToto and increased enforcement against illegal betting operators. â€” Affin Hwang Capital Research, June 11', '6/12/2018 2:56', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Lower catch rates led to higher imports required to support surimi production. As weather conditions are showing meaningful improvement, management is hopeful for better fishing yields that could return margins to healthier levels. This could be further supported by the recently commissioned new surimi plants in Hutan Melintang. In FY17, PBT margins registered at 16.7% as opposed to 13.7% in FY18. With the coming 2020 Tokyo Olympics, management mulls potential collaborations to support an anticipated surge in demand there, which could boost FY20. With its around 60% prime age profile, management is hopeful for an around 15% growth in the fresh fruit bunch (FFB) yields. In the medium term, around 30% of the plantation portfolio which is of a younger age category is poised to contribute further to FFB output. Management anticipates crude palm oil prices to trail between RM2,350 per tonne and RM2,450 per tonne for FY19. This is in line with our in-house expectation of RM2,400 per tonne on average for 2018. The egg market in Peninsular Malaysia is overcrowded as egg producers continue to scale up production. In the integrated livestock farming recent results, its Indonesian performance was dampened by poorer broiler contributions. Going forward, management expects its other markets (that is, Sabah and Sarawak, and Vietnam) to remain stable. Hence, the expanded Vietnam poultry layer unit and feed mills are expected to contribute favourably to the group. On the latest count, FamilyMart has opened 49 new stores, on track with FY18â€™s target. Management earmarks to open another 50 stores in FY19 towards their FY22 target of 300 stores. While operations are not expected to break even in FY19, management expects the store chain to become profitable in FY20 from an expected store base of around 120 branches. We continue to remain optimistic about the delivery of top-line growth amid challenges in certain sectors. This is partly thanks to the groupâ€™s well-diversified base and regional exposure. While heavy investments are geared mainly for longer-term gain under its five-year plan, the groupâ€™s market leading position should keep the company relevant amid a highly competitive landscape. However, we leave our assumptions unchanged as we believe the above-mentioned merits have been sufficiently accounted for in our estimates. Our valuation is based on an unchanged 29 times FY19 price-earning ratio. The ascribed valuation is in line with the groupâ€™s three-year mean, following a strong buying rally across the consumer space. While the group has strong fundamentals, we believe most of the positives may be already priced into its rich valuations. Furthermore, the low dividend prospects may cause yield-seeking investors to look elsewhere. Risks to our call include significant improvement to MPM sales, a significant uptick in palm oil prices and sales volume, and better-than-expected demand of poultry products abroad. â€” Kenanga Research, June 11', '6/12/2018 2:57', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

As the increase will be insignificant to the group, our forecasts are unchanged for now. Meanwhile, the main valuation rerating catalyst for the group stems from its Pengerang Deepwater Terminal (PDT) project.

Dialog trades at an FY19 PER of 36 times, below its five-year peak of 46 times.

In comparison, a similar research done by Nielsen in 2015 found that attitudes towards the GST introduction were less optimistic, with over half of Malaysians (58%) then believing the tax would be good for the economy. â€œWhile Malaysians were initially tentative towards the introduction of the GST three years ago when the tax was first announced, having experienced the effects of the GST over the past three years, they appear to welcome the move to effectively eliminate the tax, perhaps due to the gradual increase in the cost of goods and services that has occurred since its implementation as reflected in the Consumer Price Index,â€ said Nielsen Malaysia managing director Raphael Pereda in a statement. The survey showed that over half of consumers (57%) expect the prices of goods and services to decrease following the â€œzerorisationâ€ of the GST, while one-third (33%) believe that prices will remain at current levels. According to Pereda, this may mean consumer spending intentions will rise, which could result in increased sales for manufacturers and retailers. The data showed that two out of three consumers (69%) expect their purchase habits to change following the GST reduction, with close to one-third (30%) saying that they would spend more money on essential items, such as apparel and clothing, perishable foods, non-perishable foods and baby products. The survey also showed Malaysiansâ€™ willingness to increase their spending on non-essential purchases such as holidays or leisure trips (33%), new property (27%) and out-of-home entertainment (26%). One in four consumers (25%) said they will be able to channel their money towards paying off debts with the zero-rating of the GST. â€œMany retailers had been providing consumers with discounts even before the zero-rated GST was officially implemented to encourage consumers not to postpone their festive spending to after June 1, 2018. â€œIf these value-for-money promotions continue, we can expect to see an increase in sales volume compared with previous years,â€ said Pereda. The Nielsen survey also showed that 77% of the respondents view the governmentâ€™s initiative to fix the price of fuel as being â€œgood for consumersâ€, while an overwhelming nine out of 10 believe that tolls would either be removed or reduced. â€œIt is clear that the recent policy announcements made by the government have gained the approval of a vast majority of Malaysians.

To recap, Pharmaniaga has held exclusive rights since 1994 under a concession agreement (CA) to purchase a list of medical products under the MoHâ€™s approved product purchase list (APPL) from suppliers selected by the MoH, and distribute them to medical institutions under the MoHâ€™s jurisdiction. Under the CA, Pharmaniaga procures medical products at prices which have been predetermined by the MoH with its suppliers. It sells these products to the MoH at a fixed percentage markup over its purchase prices to cover its cost of inventory holding, distribution and potential inventory obsolescence. The CA was last renewed in 2009 for a period of 10 years, which will expire by November 2019. Through a tender exercise (every three years), the MoH selects the suppliers of products for the APPL based on its own product specifications and criteria. While Pharmaniaga does organise these tender exercises under the CA, we understand that it does not play any part in the selection of suppliers by the MoH. Pharmaniagaâ€™s own manufacturing segment also participates in these tenders. As of financial year 2017 (FY17), revenue from the CA made up 49% of Pharmaniagaâ€™s revenue, and was fully reflected under the logistics and distribution (L&D) segment (68.3% of FY17 revenue). In our view, margins for the CA business are thin given that the earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) margin for the overall L&D segment was 1.2% in FY17. Note that the L&D divisionâ€™s FY17 Ebit only made up 17.7% of the groupâ€™s total FY17 Ebit, with the remainder generated by its manufacturing segment (69.3%) and Indonesia operations (13%). According to media reports, the MoHâ€™s budget for medical products was at around RM3.3 billion in the L&D segment (68.3% of FY17 revenue). We estimate that only 33.4% of the MoHâ€™s budget was used for the purchase of medical products under the APPL given that Pharmaniaga is the sole supplier under the CA. We believe the remaining budget of RM2.2 billion was used to purchase drugs which fall out of the APPL list, likely through central contracts and direct purchases. Overall, we maintain our earnings estimates, â€œaddâ€ call and 12-month TP of RM4.55. This is still based on 15.9 times calendar year 2019 price-earnings ratio, a 10% discount to CIMBâ€™s pharmaceutical sector five-year target mean. Its dividend yields of 5.4% to 7.2% (FY18 to FY20) should also appeal to investors. Downside risks include lower-than-expected demand for drugs from the MoH and discontinuation of the CA. â€” CGSCIMB Research, June 11', '6/12/2018 2:53', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The major sub-sectors which registered increases in April 2018 were: Electrical and electronic equipment products (6.6%), petroleum, chemical, rubber and plastic products (3%), and non-metallic mineral products, basic metals and fabricated metal products (4.7%). â€œThe mining sector output recorded an increase of 1.8% in April 2018 compared with the same period of the previous year. This was due to an increase in the crude oil index (4.4%),â€ the department said. Meanwhile, the Natural Gas Index declined by 0.4% and the electricity output grew by 5.8% in April 2018 after recording an increase of 4.4% in March 2018. Overall, Nomura Global Markets Research, in a note yesterday, said the pickup in April IPI growth is consistent with its view that second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth will likely be supported by government spending around the general election, the return of fuel subsidies and the zero-rating of the goods and services tax (GST) in June. Looking into the third quarter, Nomura said that the boost to private consumption is likely to be modest and is unlikely to offset the hit to growth from significant government spending cuts to offset the loss in GST revenue. In a note yesterday, CIMB Research said the manufacturing recovery in Malaysia in April was broadly in line with the rebound regionally, including in Singapore, Thailand and South Korea. However, the positive external momentum that has underpinned growth in the manufacturing sector thus far, is expected to weaken, as demand from major economies and global electronics cycle normalises. â€œMoreover, we expect the governmentâ€™s cost rationalisation drive through operating expenditure cuts and cancellation of infrastructure projects to dampen investment growth, offsetting the expansionary effects on household spending from the goods and services tax (GST) cut, fuel subsidies and welfare transfers,â€ said CIMB Research, hence, maintaining its 2018 GDP growth forecast at 5.2%, below the Bloomberg consensus of 5.5%. Going forward, MIDF Research foresees IPI performances to expand at steady pace for the second half of 2018 amid escalating trade tension, moderating inflation and supportive policy changes for businesses such as zero-rated GST and stabilised retail fuel prices. Plus, MIDF Research expects the encouraging IPI growth trend in 2017 to continue in 2018 supported by robust external trade performance and gradual increase in commodity price to boost up the industrial activity in Malaysia. Brent crude oil price average at US$76.70 (RM306.03), up by 49.2% y-o-y in May, said MIDF Research, noting that the strong rise in commodity prices is due to strengthening global demand and continuous efforts of oil production limit among most oil-producing countries. â€œLower business cost partly due to moderating inflation, stable retail fuel prices and zero-rated GST will provide additional supports for industrial production growth to hit 4.3% in 2018,â€ said MIDF Research, in a note yesterday. Nevertheless, MIDF Research said headwinds from global trade tension could pose possible threat to the estimate.', '6/12/2018 2:32', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Through the online platform, RHB targets to approve RM100 million in SME loans over the course of one year. Yesterday, RHB launched its pilot run focusing on SMEs in the Klang Valley. It will introduce the platform nationwide by the third quarter of this year. The RHB SME Financing offers SME term loans with a minimum tenure of six months up to 24 months, for disbursements of between RM50,000 and RM300,000. It is eligible for businesses with an annual turnover of less than RM35 million. The online loan application only requires two documents to be uploaded, and it provides a loan simulator to help customers calculate their affordability. Application tracking can also be done via the platform. â€œOne thing that SMEs are looking for is simplicity. They find that banks are a bit complicated; they are unsure of how to do the submission and they donâ€™t have clarity as to where exactly are their applications.

Though the FBM KLCI surged by 1.25% to 1,777 points last Wednesday, spurred by the Nasdaq index booking a third record high during the week, foreign selling inched higher to RM134.2 million net on the same day, Adam noted, amid the announcement of populist policies by Italyâ€™s new government in the wake of the European Central Bankâ€™s plan to end its quantitative easing programme. â€œThe level of attrition thereafter swelled to near the RM300 million net level on (last) Thursday and (last) Friday as investors geared up for the G7 (Group of Seven) meeting, where a risk of trade war was renewed with France and Canada threatening retaliatory duties in response to US levies. â€œLast weekâ€™s abating outflows brought the year-to-date (YTD) outflow from Malaysia to US$757.6 million net or RM3.02 billion net,â€ he said. Adam said this is still the lowest among its Asean peers that MIDF Research monitors, namely Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia.

Industry coalition Padi Rescue coordinator Norfitri Amir Muhammad said trust and transparency could be reinstated with the revival of the National Rice and Paddy Board (LPN) that can establish a fund from the profit earned from rice imports to help farmers. â€œAs it stands, our study shows that monopoly holder Padiberas Nasional Bhd (Bernas) earns a profit margin of RM700 per tonne from the imported rice. Imagine what their profit must be like? â€œIf the LPN is revived with the participation of farmers, it will be an independent body made up by people who know the sector. Profit from imports [of rice] could go into the fund to help the sector in emergencies like disease-ridden plants and floods,â€ he told a media conference yesterday. Norfitri said the problem cannot be solved with just the appointment of a group of companies handling the imports because it does not resolve the low demand for local rice. â€œFarmers donâ€™t have the bargaining power to ask for good prices. This sector is not one that should be seen as a profit-making sector. The subsidy for padi is about RM2.2 billion but who benefits? â€œThe contract holders for fertilisers or insecticides mark up the prices. The government must review these contracts because it [can] save money here. So we should not be looking at Bernas only but at every level, hence the need for the LPN (which was first set up in the 1970s),â€ he added. Last week, Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Minister Salahuddin Ayub announced the termination of tycoon Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhariâ€™s Bernasâ€™ rice import monopoly. Bernas took over from the LPN in 1996 and was listed a year later on Bursa Malaysia before it was taken private. In 2011, its concession to import rice was extended for another 10 years until 2021. However, as part of the Pakatan Harapan governmentâ€™s manifesto to break Bernasâ€™ monopoly, a working paper with ministry feedback and other stakeholders is being drafted to be submitted to the government for further action. According to a study by the Malay Economic Action Council (MTEM), an umbrella body representing 47 Malay non-governmental organisations, local rice farmers milled 1.82 billion tonnes of rice last year, and up to 900,000 tonnes of rice were imported by Bernas, mostly from Vietnam, to meet the shortfall of 2.75 billion tonnes for consumption in Malaysia. Malaysia imports 30% of rice. Norfitri said Malaysian farmers are able to make up to 100% of local demand but due to bad management of the industry, including weak seeds because of a lack of research and development, and high costs of fertilisers and insecticides. Padi Rescue is an organisation of farmers under the MTEM. Local farmer Azhar Hashim, 50, said a government subsidy of RM2,000 per hectare is high, but farmers still experience losses because of alleged discrepancies in the sector like the sale of insecticides at RM90 a bottle compared with RM40 in countries like Thailand.', '6/12/2018 2:19', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Asia is now home to 27% of the people on the list, second only to North America. Asiaâ€™s ultra-rich are increasingly looking for more complex and global investments as a record number of patriarchs cede control to the next generation. Younger family members whose wealth came from traditional industries such as real estate and natural resources often seek to diversify into biotech and digital businesses, with Silicon Valley of particular interest for those seeking to invest directly, Mahesh said. Last year, Zurich-based UBS secured a private-funds license in China, allowing the investment unit to start managing money for mainland institutional and high-net-worth investors in Asiaâ€™s largest economy. â€œIn Asia, the clients are less advanced in terms of the sophistication of the family offices structures,â€ said Sara Ferrari, head of the Global Family Office. â€œWeâ€™re moving as they are moving.â€ The firm may add to its team of about 100 family-office bankers in the region, Ferrari said. In Europe, by contrast, she said it expects to grow by increasing revenues with existing clients. UBS started the Global Family Office unit about seven years ago to sell the firmâ€™s funds and investment-banking advice to the largest and most active wealth clients, partly to prevent bigger investment banks from siphoning off revenue from billionaire families. It has a strong presence where most of the worldâ€™s wealth is stored â€” in places like Switzerland, Hong Kong and Singapore â€” though it lacks the investment-banking clout of JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Competition is intensifying, with Credit Suisse Group AG tilting toward wealth management and Goldman aiming to add more than 200 private wealth advisers over the next two years. JPMorgan offers its large family-office clients an array of services, from access to direct private equity and real estate deals to M&A and brokerage advice. Invested assets at Global Family Office, which cross-sells equities trading, derivatives and deal advice, have doubled over the past five years to 120 billion Swiss francs (US$121.8 billion). But UBS feels it could do more for family-office clients, which became a renewed target for growth after Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti combined the bankâ€™s disparate wealth management units into one, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. â€˜Under Pressureâ€™ Over the next two to three years, gross margins in wealth management â€œwill continue to be under pressureâ€ Ermotti said at a May 30 investor conference, adding that it would be wishful thinking to expect margins on deposits to return to levels seen before the financial crisis. That means banks canâ€™t rely on revenues from sitting on customer cash â€” even if it amounts to billions of dollars. In the US, thereâ€™s a â€œbig opportunityâ€ for UBS from closer cooperation between the investment bank and wealth management to serve ultra-high net worth and Global Family Office clients, Ermotti said. Family offices have mushroomed in recent years as private wealth surged and more people took an interest in actively managing their affairs, said John Matthews, head of private wealth management and ultra-high net worth for UBS Wealth Management Americas. Newer, more flexible iterations of the traditional model â€” such as family offices that are virtual or manage money pooled from several families â€” mean family offices can make sense for a wider range people. â€œYears ago, you had to have around US$500 million to have a legitimate family office,â€ Matthews said. â€œThat number is going down now, to around US$200 to US$150 million.â€ Outside Help The family-office concept is relatively new in Asia, despite rapid wealth accumulation there. An estimated 17% of the worldâ€™s 5,300 single-family offices are based on the continent, according to Campden Wealth. The nascent market offers banks a chance to get in early when families most need outside help. For clients in North America â€” where almost almost half of family offices are found â€” UBSâ€™s role skews more toward helping established family offices to access different types of investment products across the bank or helping them develop specific strategies around issues like capital preservation or philanthropy. One area of mutual interest for Global Family Office clients is meeting other families. Such connections may yield co-investments or simply offer a chance to swap information on issues unique to the worldâ€™s richest people. When the bank was recently invited to pitch to a US family office in its third generation, competing against rival banks, the request was for a specific mandate in the markets, Matthews said. â€œBut the conversation actually turned to two key elements,â€ he said. â€œCan you make introductions to us to like-minded families in Asia? And the second piece was non-investment issues â€” like trust and estate work, governance. They rewarded us with a fairly large mandate.â€', '6/12/2018 4:00', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Housing finance fell 1.4% in April, the fifth straight monthly drop and the longest stretch of declines since September 2008, when Lehman Brothers Inc. collapsed and a month before the Reserve Bank of Australia slashed its key interest rate by a percentage point. The downturn is most prominent in Sydney where prices slid 4.2% in May from a year earlier, when they were rising at an annual pace of 17%. Sales at auctions â€” a popular way of marketing houses Down Under â€” have slumped to the lowest since early 2016 in Australiaâ€™s biggest city, with only around half of properties successfully selling. A key factor weighing on Sydneyâ€™s market is tighter credit, as regulators force banks to cut back on the riskiest mortgages. Fewer interest-only loans â€” which are cheaper in the early years because borrowers donâ€™t repay principal â€” means Sydney prices are now out of reach for many investors. Chinese buyers, a previous driver of demand, have also receded due to difficulties in moving cash from the mainland. For Australian borrowers, thereâ€™s little prospect of relief for household income as wage growth has stagnated for the past five years. The economyâ€™s private debt-to-income ratio is also at a record 189%, leaving little scope to increase leverage anyway. Meanwhile, high-income owner-occupiers have less borrowing power due to tighter checks on their real spending levels as part of the mortgage approval process. Previously they could rely on benchmarks that were unrealistically low. Market bulls point to Australiaâ€™s population growth and record-low interest rates â€” unchanged at 1.5% for almost two years â€” as reasons to expect a soft landing in the property market.

Today, in an age of affluence not even the Astors and Vanderbilts might have imagined, there is something closer to a List of 55. Its members are so rich that, in rarefied corners of Wall Street, they seem less like actual people than vast investment empires. Their ranks include familiar names like Bezos and Dell, as well as a growing number of lesser lights whose dynastic wealth is reshaping global business, if not capitalism itself. This unofficial list represents the first, rough cut of the most sought-after banking clients at JPMorgan Chase & Co, and it is by no means complete. To the contrary: The List of 55 is only the beginning. Around the globe, bankers are vying for the worldâ€™s hyper-wealthy as never before. And they are holding out investments that are tantalizingly off-limits to the rest of us, behind a velvet rope of bespoke investment banking. This is how the super-rich keep getting super-richer. Anyone can buy stocks. Only a privileged few can bankroll multimillion-dollar ventures or buy entire companies. Private equity â€” that lucrative and, at times, controversial force of modern finance â€” has become a playground of the new aristocracy. It was bound to happen. Like so many things, investing is becoming increasingly stratified. Private bankers now say that entry-class â€œrichâ€ starts at about US$25 million. But you need more than that â€” typically at least 40 times more, or about US$1 billion â€” if you want a ticket into serious deal-making. Yet, on another level, the rich-ification of private equity harks back to another time. This era of extreme wealth and extreme inequality is minting private dynasties that rival public corporations. On Wall Street, many executives expect the billionaire-whisperers, like merchant bankers of old, to accrue even more financial power. Some of the people who tend these family fortunes say privately that bankers can seem irrelevant. They say their success doesnâ€™t hinge on the banks. The worn-out trope â€” this is a new Gilded Age â€” may not be far off. Not since the days of John D. Rockefeller has so much been owned by so few. â€œThis is a new world thatâ€™s been around, basically, forever,â€ said David Dwek, head of private sponsors at Morgan Stanley. â€œThey are an important part of the deal ecosystem.â€ Wealthy families have always been choice clients for bankers. Today, major banks woo billionaires and their family offices much the way they do multinational corporations or deep-pocketed institutional investors. Services range from advising on mergers and acquisitions to arranging financing for portfolio companies to providing counsel on expanding or selling family businesses. Around the globe, bankers are vying for the worldâ€™s hyper-wealthy as never before Granted, investing is a risky business, even for billionaires. The recent implosion of Steinhoff International Holdings NV, for instance, cost the South African tycoon Christo Wiese, the companyâ€™s biggest shareholder, the equivalent of more than US$3 billion in net worth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Banks that lent Wiese money against his stock have lost roughly US$1 billion. Still, with so much money and influence at stake, bankers are pitching hard. Goldman Sachs Group Inc has its own list of 60, counting among its clients the Reimann familyâ€™s JAB Holding Co and the Koch brothersâ€™ investment firm. JPMorgan, in addition to its initial 55, is watching several hundred families that are poised to enter this rarefied realm. Credit Suisse Group AG, which has retreated from wealth management for less-well-heeled customers, reserves its ultimate white-glove treatment for about 200 moneyed individuals and clans. Deutsche Bank AG and UBS Group AG have separate units that bridge private wealth management and investment banking. At Morgan Stanley, Dwekâ€™s team targets â€œpermanent capital,â€ or money from families, sovereign wealth funds, pension systems and listed investment companies. The operation began about eight years ago as part of an effort to pull wealthy families into Morgan Stanleyâ€™s orbit. Over at JPMorgan, bankers in April arranged financing for an acquisition of Texas-based food company C.H. Guenther & Son by PPC Partners. The investment company is controlled by the Pritzker family, one of Americaâ€™s richest clans. Paul Carbone leads PPC with Tony Pritzker, and together they focus on North American companies valued between US$100 million and US$750 million. Carbone, formerly managing partner of the private-equity group at Robert W. Baird & Co, said PPC doesnâ€™t rely on bank-led auctions to source most of its deals. Rather, banks tend to serve as intermediaries and pitch firms such as PPC to business owners looking to sell or expand. The banksâ€™ goal, as he put it: â€œto put people together who have like interests, in a very old-world sort of way.â€ â€œWeâ€™re trying to reach people where theyâ€™re most passionateâ€ Credit Suisse, which has also advised PPC, went as far as to organize an event in Detroit to nurture ties with Daniel Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans Inc, and other super-affluent types. (Gilbert, who co-hosted the event, is worth more than US$7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.) Representatives of 43 families worth a combined US$75 billion attended the May 2017 event. The official topic was revitalizing Detroit. If Credit Suisse drummed up business, so much the better. Credit Suisse was already financing mortgage originations for Quicken Loans. But the bank sees its relationship with Gilbert as valuable even beyond his company, said Charles Buckley, head of ultra-high net worth coverage for North America. â€œWeâ€™re trying to reach people where theyâ€™re most passionate,â€ Buckley said. â€œSometimes thatâ€™s in traditional investment-banking ways, but sometimes itâ€™s not. Sometimes itâ€™s helping them revitalize Detroit.â€ Buckley now oversees a US$3 billion portfolio of loans made chiefly against billionairesâ€™ stakes in private companies, as well as a team of 20 bankers. â€œIt could be a block trade one day, and they may want to tap into public markets another,â€ said Shideh Theunissen, Buckleyâ€™s lieutenant. Itâ€™s almost impossible to put a specific number on the money thatâ€™s at stake. The Pritzkersâ€™ PPC Partners, Paul Allenâ€™s Vulcan and Stone Canyon Industries, backed by Michael Milken, are among the more recognizable names. Many others fly under the radar. And not all billionaires are looking to acquire companies or take stakes in private ventures. Still, activity has been heating up, particularly in middle-market transactions. The value of deals done by family offices jumped to US$100.6 billion in 2016, from US$25.1 billion five years earlier, according to PitchBook data. Private bankers now say that entry-class â€œrichâ€ starts at about US$25 million. But you need more than that if you want a ticket into serious deal-making. Major banks must compete with an established cast of specialized boutiques. Byron Trott, known for his long-term links to Warren Buffett, caters to the worldâ€™s wealthy; his firm, BDT Capital Partners, has used its connections to raise billions for private-equity funds. One of the grand old names in banking, Rothschild & Co, has also been expanding lately, with an eye toward the ultra-rich. It helped the Koch brothers finance Meredith Corpâ€™s takeover of Time Inc last year. Another boutique, Moelis & Co, has won the favor of hedge fund manager-turned-Sears Chief Executive Officer Edward Lampert, as well as casino mogul Steve Wynn. Aryeh Bourkoffâ€™s LionTree Advisors works closely with the tycoon John Malone. Major banks want to bring good deals to family offices, partly to avoid losing business to the boutiques and middle-market investment banks, said Bill Woodson, who leads Citi Private Bankâ€™s family-office group in North America. Woodsonâ€™s unit, with four private bankers and two investment bankers, shepherds large family offices looking to make deals from one area of the bank to another. Bigger banks still are trying to adjust to the new realities. Over the years, even as rich lists exploded, many large global banks became so fragmented that billionaires simply outgrew them and hired their own investment professionals. In the past, many bankers were so focused on corporate clients and other big institutional investors that they largely ignored individual fortunes. Investment bankers might even drop a billionaireâ€™s family office as a client, figuring that pitching deals to it wasnâ€™t worth the hassle. No more. â€œFrom our perspective, theyâ€™re No. 1 or No. 2 on a call list,â€ said Todd Stevens, head of the key client partners business at Deutsche Bank.', '6/12/2018 3:19', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Management focused mainly on the recent acquisition of Genaxis (51% subsidiary) and Innovation Associates Consulting (IAC) (60% subsidiary via Genaxis). According to management, IAC has the edge when it comes to government contracts as it is cheaper but tends to fall short in the private sector given the lack of global experience. Nevertheless, IAC received the contract to implement 1GFMAS (Government Financial and Management Accounting System) valued at RM151.4 million for three years. Besides that, Genaxis has a current order book of RM20 million, and is aggressively bidding for other contracts in the public and private sectors. We believe DNeXâ€™s position as a government service provider is enhanced by the acquisition of the two consulting firms. Management revealed that 30%-owned Ping Petroleum is diversifying its asset base. We understand that Ping will begin development of its Avalon greenfield located in the North Sea, offshore Ireland. Additionally, the group is bidding for additional exploration fields in the North Sea. Furthermore, Ping has begun bidding for an additional brownfield similar to Anasuria after losing the bid for a similar brownfield asset last year. Despite the large expected capital expenditure required, DNeX intends to request Ping to pay out dividends, given strong cash flows from the Anasuria operations. Note that Anasuriaâ€™s cash flows are directly linked to crude oil price, and oil production is expected to increase after the maintenance activities carried out in financial year 2017 (FY17). DNeX announced that it would provide connectivity between the existing vehicle entry permit (VEP) system and TnG. The contract is expected to generate revenue of RM19 million to RM21 million per annum with a gross profit margin of around 35%. We understand that the RFID tag is currently encrypted on foreign vehicles entering Malaysia. However, going forward, we believe the goal is to equip all local vehicles with the RFID tag and collect toll payments via RFID. Additionally, DNeX is the sole supplier for this service in Malaysia given its link to the VEP. That said, the new governmentâ€™s promise to abolish tolls may result in some downside risk. On the other hand, management revealed that the subcontract via Bukti Megah to rehire foreign workers has ended. OGPC Sdn Bhd secured a contract to supply portable container systems (PCS) to Petro Teguh last year. Management noted that delivery is way behind schedule and shared that only seven systems were delivered in FY17 whilst one was delivered in the first quarter of FY18. It still expects to deliver around 50 units in FY18 and the remainder in FY19. We note that a contract tenure extension is likely, given the delays on-site. DNeX revealed that the delays were mainly due to on-site dealers taking longer than expected to meet regulatory requirements. DNeX is working closely with Petro Teguh to rectify the problems at the various installation sites. Note that DNeXâ€™s task under the contract is only to supply the PCS. Therefore, we believe that DNeX will not incur any penalties for the delays. DNeXâ€™s long-term outlook seems secure on the back of its Sealnet (previously known as 1Trade) trade facilitation system and development of Avalon field by Ping Petroleum. â€” TA Securities Research, June 11', '6/12/2018 3:00', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The three-month â€œtax-freeâ€ period will no doubt be a boost to short-term earnings, but it does not address the structural problems facing the industry. We believe BTotoâ€™s revenue was cut by 2% under the previous GST regime, as the company absorbed the cost instead of passing this on to its customers. The impact on BToto to its bottom line was more significant at around -20% a year. However, we are of the view that the new SST regime could still expand to include number forecast operators (NFOs), as they contributed around RM150 million in GST based on our estimates, and this inclusion would also not have any direct impact on consumers. Hence, the higher profitability is only likely to last for the three months (June to August) before the SST is reintroduced in September. The decline in NFOsâ€™ revenue is a structural problem due to the more attractive payouts from illegal operators, and we believe the zero-rated GST will be help resolve the problem. We believe that operators could have tweaked the payout to pass on the impact of the GST, but the widening of the current payout difference (against illegal operators), at around 28%, could cause a significant dip in revenue. Unless there is a step-up in enforcement, or an increase in payout (which we think is unlikely for now), the problem is likely to persist, in which case the NFOs might not be able to enjoy the full benefit of the improving consumer sentiment. As we are not expecting the benefits from the tax holiday to last beyond the three-month period, we are keeping our dividend discount model-based TP unchanged at RM2.20, but downgrading our call to â€œsellâ€ from â€œholdâ€ due to the recent run-up in share price post the announcement. Upside risks include the no further taxes implemented on BToto and increased enforcement against illegal betting operators. â€” Affin Hwang Capital Research, June 11', '6/12/2018 2:56', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Lower catch rates led to higher imports required to support surimi production. As weather conditions are showing meaningful improvement, management is hopeful for better fishing yields that could return margins to healthier levels. This could be further supported by the recently commissioned new surimi plants in Hutan Melintang. In FY17, PBT margins registered at 16.7% as opposed to 13.7% in FY18. With the coming 2020 Tokyo Olympics, management mulls potential collaborations to support an anticipated surge in demand there, which could boost FY20. With its around 60% prime age profile, management is hopeful for an around 15% growth in the fresh fruit bunch (FFB) yields. In the medium term, around 30% of the plantation portfolio which is of a younger age category is poised to contribute further to FFB output. Management anticipates crude palm oil prices to trail between RM2,350 per tonne and RM2,450 per tonne for FY19. This is in line with our in-house expectation of RM2,400 per tonne on average for 2018. The egg market in Peninsular Malaysia is overcrowded as egg producers continue to scale up production. In the integrated livestock farming recent results, its Indonesian performance was dampened by poorer broiler contributions. Going forward, management expects its other markets (that is, Sabah and Sarawak, and Vietnam) to remain stable. Hence, the expanded Vietnam poultry layer unit and feed mills are expected to contribute favourably to the group. On the latest count, FamilyMart has opened 49 new stores, on track with FY18â€™s target. Management earmarks to open another 50 stores in FY19 towards their FY22 target of 300 stores. While operations are not expected to break even in FY19, management expects the store chain to become profitable in FY20 from an expected store base of around 120 branches. We continue to remain optimistic about the delivery of top-line growth amid challenges in certain sectors. This is partly thanks to the groupâ€™s well-diversified base and regional exposure. While heavy investments are geared mainly for longer-term gain under its five-year plan, the groupâ€™s market leading position should keep the company relevant amid a highly competitive landscape. However, we leave our assumptions unchanged as we believe the above-mentioned merits have been sufficiently accounted for in our estimates. Our valuation is based on an unchanged 29 times FY19 price-earning ratio. The ascribed valuation is in line with the groupâ€™s three-year mean, following a strong buying rally across the consumer space. While the group has strong fundamentals, we believe most of the positives may be already priced into its rich valuations. Furthermore, the low dividend prospects may cause yield-seeking investors to look elsewhere. Risks to our call include significant improvement to MPM sales, a significant uptick in palm oil prices and sales volume, and better-than-expected demand of poultry products abroad. â€” Kenanga Research, June 11', '6/12/2018 2:57', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

As the increase will be insignificant to the group, our forecasts are unchanged for now. Meanwhile, the main valuation rerating catalyst for the group stems from its Pengerang Deepwater Terminal (PDT) project.

Dialog trades at an FY19 PER of 36 times, below its five-year peak of 46 times.

In comparison, a similar research done by Nielsen in 2015 found that attitudes towards the GST introduction were less optimistic, with over half of Malaysians (58%) then believing the tax would be good for the economy. â€œWhile Malaysians were initially tentative towards the introduction of the GST three years ago when the tax was first announced, having experienced the effects of the GST over the past three years, they appear to welcome the move to effectively eliminate the tax, perhaps due to the gradual increase in the cost of goods and services that has occurred since its implementation as reflected in the Consumer Price Index,â€ said Nielsen Malaysia managing director Raphael Pereda in a statement. The survey showed that over half of consumers (57%) expect the prices of goods and services to decrease following the â€œzerorisationâ€ of the GST, while one-third (33%) believe that prices will remain at current levels. According to Pereda, this may mean consumer spending intentions will rise, which could result in increased sales for manufacturers and retailers. The data showed that two out of three consumers (69%) expect their purchase habits to change following the GST reduction, with close to one-third (30%) saying that they would spend more money on essential items, such as apparel and clothing, perishable foods, non-perishable foods and baby products. The survey also showed Malaysiansâ€™ willingness to increase their spending on non-essential purchases such as holidays or leisure trips (33%), new property (27%) and out-of-home entertainment (26%). One in four consumers (25%) said they will be able to channel their money towards paying off debts with the zero-rating of the GST. â€œMany retailers had been providing consumers with discounts even before the zero-rated GST was officially implemented to encourage consumers not to postpone their festive spending to after June 1, 2018. â€œIf these value-for-money promotions continue, we can expect to see an increase in sales volume compared with previous years,â€ said Pereda. The Nielsen survey also showed that 77% of the respondents view the governmentâ€™s initiative to fix the price of fuel as being â€œgood for consumersâ€, while an overwhelming nine out of 10 believe that tolls would either be removed or reduced. â€œIt is clear that the recent policy announcements made by the government have gained the approval of a vast majority of Malaysians.

To recap, Pharmaniaga has held exclusive rights since 1994 under a concession agreement (CA) to purchase a list of medical products under the MoHâ€™s approved product purchase list (APPL) from suppliers selected by the MoH, and distribute them to medical institutions under the MoHâ€™s jurisdiction. Under the CA, Pharmaniaga procures medical products at prices which have been predetermined by the MoH with its suppliers. It sells these products to the MoH at a fixed percentage markup over its purchase prices to cover its cost of inventory holding, distribution and potential inventory obsolescence. The CA was last renewed in 2009 for a period of 10 years, which will expire by November 2019. Through a tender exercise (every three years), the MoH selects the suppliers of products for the APPL based on its own product specifications and criteria. While Pharmaniaga does organise these tender exercises under the CA, we understand that it does not play any part in the selection of suppliers by the MoH. Pharmaniagaâ€™s own manufacturing segment also participates in these tenders. As of financial year 2017 (FY17), revenue from the CA made up 49% of Pharmaniagaâ€™s revenue, and was fully reflected under the logistics and distribution (L&D) segment (68.3% of FY17 revenue). In our view, margins for the CA business are thin given that the earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) margin for the overall L&D segment was 1.2% in FY17. Note that the L&D divisionâ€™s FY17 Ebit only made up 17.7% of the groupâ€™s total FY17 Ebit, with the remainder generated by its manufacturing segment (69.3%) and Indonesia operations (13%). According to media reports, the MoHâ€™s budget for medical products was at around RM3.3 billion in the L&D segment (68.3% of FY17 revenue). We estimate that only 33.4% of the MoHâ€™s budget was used for the purchase of medical products under the APPL given that Pharmaniaga is the sole supplier under the CA. We believe the remaining budget of RM2.2 billion was used to purchase drugs which fall out of the APPL list, likely through central contracts and direct purchases. Overall, we maintain our earnings estimates, â€œaddâ€ call and 12-month TP of RM4.55. This is still based on 15.9 times calendar year 2019 price-earnings ratio, a 10% discount to CIMBâ€™s pharmaceutical sector five-year target mean. Its dividend yields of 5.4% to 7.2% (FY18 to FY20) should also appeal to investors. Downside risks include lower-than-expected demand for drugs from the MoH and discontinuation of the CA. â€” CGSCIMB Research, June 11', '6/12/2018 2:53', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The major sub-sectors which registered increases in April 2018 were: Electrical and electronic equipment products (6.6%), petroleum, chemical, rubber and plastic products (3%), and non-metallic mineral products, basic metals and fabricated metal products (4.7%). â€œThe mining sector output recorded an increase of 1.8% in April 2018 compared with the same period of the previous year. This was due to an increase in the crude oil index (4.4%),â€ the department said. Meanwhile, the Natural Gas Index declined by 0.4% and the electricity output grew by 5.8% in April 2018 after recording an increase of 4.4% in March 2018. Overall, Nomura Global Markets Research, in a note yesterday, said the pickup in April IPI growth is consistent with its view that second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth will likely be supported by government spending around the general election, the return of fuel subsidies and the zero-rating of the goods and services tax (GST) in June. Looking into the third quarter, Nomura said that the boost to private consumption is likely to be modest and is unlikely to offset the hit to growth from significant government spending cuts to offset the loss in GST revenue. In a note yesterday, CIMB Research said the manufacturing recovery in Malaysia in April was broadly in line with the rebound regionally, including in Singapore, Thailand and South Korea. However, the positive external momentum that has underpinned growth in the manufacturing sector thus far, is expected to weaken, as demand from major economies and global electronics cycle normalises. â€œMoreover, we expect the governmentâ€™s cost rationalisation drive through operating expenditure cuts and cancellation of infrastructure projects to dampen investment growth, offsetting the expansionary effects on household spending from the goods and services tax (GST) cut, fuel subsidies and welfare transfers,â€ said CIMB Research, hence, maintaining its 2018 GDP growth forecast at 5.2%, below the Bloomberg consensus of 5.5%. Going forward, MIDF Research foresees IPI performances to expand at steady pace for the second half of 2018 amid escalating trade tension, moderating inflation and supportive policy changes for businesses such as zero-rated GST and stabilised retail fuel prices. Plus, MIDF Research expects the encouraging IPI growth trend in 2017 to continue in 2018 supported by robust external trade performance and gradual increase in commodity price to boost up the industrial activity in Malaysia. Brent crude oil price average at US$76.70 (RM306.03), up by 49.2% y-o-y in May, said MIDF Research, noting that the strong rise in commodity prices is due to strengthening global demand and continuous efforts of oil production limit among most oil-producing countries. â€œLower business cost partly due to moderating inflation, stable retail fuel prices and zero-rated GST will provide additional supports for industrial production growth to hit 4.3% in 2018,â€ said MIDF Research, in a note yesterday. Nevertheless, MIDF Research said headwinds from global trade tension could pose possible threat to the estimate.', '6/12/2018 2:32', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Through the online platform, RHB targets to approve RM100 million in SME loans over the course of one year. Yesterday, RHB launched its pilot run focusing on SMEs in the Klang Valley. It will introduce the platform nationwide by the third quarter of this year. The RHB SME Financing offers SME term loans with a minimum tenure of six months up to 24 months, for disbursements of between RM50,000 and RM300,000. It is eligible for businesses with an annual turnover of less than RM35 million. The online loan application only requires two documents to be uploaded, and it provides a loan simulator to help customers calculate their affordability. Application tracking can also be done via the platform. â€œOne thing that SMEs are looking for is simplicity. They find that banks are a bit complicated; they are unsure of how to do the submission and they donâ€™t have clarity as to where exactly are their applications. So with this platform, we are trying to address that gap. We reduce document requirements and we also tell them exactly at which point is their application process,â€ Ng added. Ng said Malaysia has about 900,000 SMEs, and close to 20% of that have some form of relationship with RHB, giving the bank an SME loan market share of 9% as of 2017. â€œThe SME market itself has a lot of depth and is still underpenetrated so there is still room to grow for the banking industry.

On reports in April saying that Siem Offshore Rederi AS would emerge as Daya Materialsâ€™ largest shareholder with an over 20% stake if the latter can successfully implement its regularisation plan, Lim said the news caught management by surprise as the company was not supposed to talk about it. Nevertheless, he said the company will discuss with many parties, including Siem Offshore Rederi, bankers and other stakeholders, to work out the regularisation plan to lift its PN17 status, which was triggered after its shareholder equity retreated to under 25% of its issued capital as at Dec 31, 2017. The company is looking to submit the plan by August, way before the February 2019 deadline, Lim told reporters after the groupâ€™s annual general meeting yesterday. Currently, he said the company is finalising the appointment of the principal adviser and is discussing with stakeholders and bondholders to work out the plan. Meanwhile, Lim said the RM600 million worth of orders in hand should keep the company busy for the next five years, and that, together with existing offshore subsea construction contracts, should give the company a â€œpositive contributionâ€ in FY18. Daya Materials narrowed its net loss to RM41.2 million in FY17 against a net loss of RM147.15 million in FY16, as revenue surged 135% year-on-year to RM116.86 million from RM49.79 million.

Though the FBM KLCI surged by 1.25% to 1,777 points last Wednesday, spurred by the Nasdaq index booking a third record high during the week, foreign selling inched higher to RM134.2 million net on the same day, Adam noted, amid the announcement of populist policies by Italyâ€™s new government in the wake of the European Central Bankâ€™s plan to end its quantitative easing programme. â€œThe level of attrition thereafter swelled to near the RM300 million net level on (last) Thursday and (last) Friday as investors geared up for the G7 (Group of Seven) meeting, where a risk of trade war was renewed with France and Canada threatening retaliatory duties in response to US levies. â€œLast weekâ€™s abating outflows brought the year-to-date (YTD) outflow from Malaysia to US$757.6 million net or RM3.02 billion net,â€ he said. Adam said this is still the lowest among its Asean peers that MIDF Research monitors, namely Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia. Foreign participation remained healthy, he said, as the foreign average daily trade value remained above the RM1 billion mark at RM1.64 billion despite retreating from its all-time high achieved in the week before. He said the retail market and local funds saw buying activity extending to its fourth and sixth week respectively.

Investors can get to see among others, people who work in risk departments at banks, who can tell them how theyâ€™re classifying loans, he said.

Industry coalition Padi Rescue coordinator Norfitri Amir Muhammad said trust and transparency could be reinstated with the revival of the National Rice and Paddy Board (LPN) that can establish a fund from the profit earned from rice imports to help farmers. â€œAs it stands, our study shows that monopoly holder Padiberas Nasional Bhd (Bernas) earns a profit margin of RM700 per tonne from the imported rice. Imagine what their profit must be like? â€œIf the LPN is revived with the participation of farmers, it will be an independent body made up by people who know the sector. Profit from imports [of rice] could go into the fund to help the sector in emergencies like disease-ridden plants and floods,â€ he told a media conference yesterday. Norfitri said the problem cannot be solved with just the appointment of a group of companies handling the imports because it does not resolve the low demand for local rice. â€œFarmers donâ€™t have the bargaining power to ask for good prices. This sector is not one that should be seen as a profit-making sector. The subsidy for padi is about RM2.2 billion but who benefits? â€œThe contract holders for fertilisers or insecticides mark up the prices. The government must review these contracts because it [can] save money here. So we should not be looking at Bernas only but at every level, hence the need for the LPN (which was first set up in the 1970s),â€ he added. Last week, Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Minister Salahuddin Ayub announced the termination of tycoon Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhariâ€™s Bernasâ€™ rice import monopoly. Bernas took over from the LPN in 1996 and was listed a year later on Bursa Malaysia before it was taken private. In 2011, its concession to import rice was extended for another 10 years until 2021. However, as part of the Pakatan Harapan governmentâ€™s manifesto to break Bernasâ€™ monopoly, a working paper with ministry feedback and other stakeholders is being drafted to be submitted to the government for further action. According to a study by the Malay Economic Action Council (MTEM), an umbrella body representing 47 Malay non-governmental organisations, local rice farmers milled 1.82 billion tonnes of rice last year, and up to 900,000 tonnes of rice were imported by Bernas, mostly from Vietnam, to meet the shortfall of 2.75 billion tonnes for consumption in Malaysia. Malaysia imports 30% of rice. Norfitri said Malaysian farmers are able to make up to 100% of local demand but due to bad management of the industry, including weak seeds because of a lack of research and development, and high costs of fertilisers and insecticides. Padi Rescue is an organisation of farmers under the MTEM. Local farmer Azhar Hashim, 50, said a government subsidy of RM2,000 per hectare is high, but farmers still experience losses because of alleged discrepancies in the sector like the sale of insecticides at RM90 a bottle compared with RM40 in countries like Thailand.', '6/12/2018 2:19', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Asia is now home to 27% of the people on the list, second only to North America. Asiaâ€™s ultra-rich are increasingly looking for more complex and global investments as a record number of patriarchs cede control to the next generation. Younger family members whose wealth came from traditional industries such as real estate and natural resources often seek to diversify into biotech and digital businesses, with Silicon Valley of particular interest for those seeking to invest directly, Mahesh said. Last year, Zurich-based UBS secured a private-funds license in China, allowing the investment unit to start managing money for mainland institutional and high-net-worth investors in Asiaâ€™s largest economy. â€œIn Asia, the clients are less advanced in terms of the sophistication of the family offices structures,â€ said Sara Ferrari, head of the Global Family Office. â€œWeâ€™re moving as they are moving.â€ The firm may add to its team of about 100 family-office bankers in the region, Ferrari said. In Europe, by contrast, she said it expects to grow by increasing revenues with existing clients. UBS started the Global Family Office unit about seven years ago to sell the firmâ€™s funds and investment-banking advice to the largest and most active wealth clients, partly to prevent bigger investment banks from siphoning off revenue from billionaire families. It has a strong presence where most of the worldâ€™s wealth is stored â€” in places like Switzerland, Hong Kong and Singapore â€” though it lacks the investment-banking clout of JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Competition is intensifying, with Credit Suisse Group AG tilting toward wealth management and Goldman aiming to add more than 200 private wealth advisers over the next two years. JPMorgan offers its large family-office clients an array of services, from access to direct private equity and real estate deals to M&A and brokerage advice. Invested assets at Global Family Office, which cross-sells equities trading, derivatives and deal advice, have doubled over the past five years to 120 billion Swiss francs (US$121.8 billion). But UBS feels it could do more for family-office clients, which became a renewed target for growth after Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti combined the bankâ€™s disparate wealth management units into one, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. â€˜Under Pressureâ€™ Over the next two to three years, gross margins in wealth management â€œwill continue to be under pressureâ€ Ermotti said at a May 30 investor conference, adding that it would be wishful thinking to expect margins on deposits to return to levels seen before the financial crisis. That means banks canâ€™t rely on revenues from sitting on customer cash â€” even if it amounts to billions of dollars. In the US, thereâ€™s a â€œbig opportunityâ€ for UBS from closer cooperation between the investment bank and wealth management to serve ultra-high net worth and Global Family Office clients, Ermotti said. Family offices have mushroomed in recent years as private wealth surged and more people took an interest in actively managing their affairs, said John Matthews, head of private wealth management and ultra-high net worth for UBS Wealth Management Americas. Newer, more flexible iterations of the traditional model â€” such as family offices that are virtual or manage money pooled from several families â€” mean family offices can make sense for a wider range people. â€œYears ago, you had to have around US$500 million to have a legitimate family office,â€ Matthews said. â€œThat number is going down now, to around US$200 to US$150 million.â€ Outside Help The family-office concept is relatively new in Asia, despite rapid wealth accumulation there. An estimated 17% of the worldâ€™s 5,300 single-family offices are based on the continent, according to Campden Wealth. The nascent market offers banks a chance to get in early when families most need outside help. For clients in North America â€” where almost almost half of family offices are found â€” UBSâ€™s role skews more toward helping established family offices to access different types of investment products across the bank or helping them develop specific strategies around issues like capital preservation or philanthropy. One area of mutual interest for Global Family Office clients is meeting other families. Such connections may yield co-investments or simply offer a chance to swap information on issues unique to the worldâ€™s richest people. When the bank was recently invited to pitch to a US family office in its third generation, competing against rival banks, the request was for a specific mandate in the markets, Matthews said. â€œBut the conversation actually turned to two key elements,â€ he said. â€œCan you make introductions to us to like-minded families in Asia? And the second piece was non-investment issues â€” like trust and estate work, governance. They rewarded us with a fairly large mandate.â€', '6/12/2018 4:00', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Housing finance fell 1.4% in April, the fifth straight monthly drop and the longest stretch of declines since September 2008, when Lehman Brothers Inc. collapsed and a month before the Reserve Bank of Australia slashed its key interest rate by a percentage point. The downturn is most prominent in Sydney where prices slid 4.2% in May from a year earlier, when they were rising at an annual pace of 17%. Sales at auctions â€” a popular way of marketing houses Down Under â€” have slumped to the lowest since early 2016 in Australiaâ€™s biggest city, with only around half of properties successfully selling. A key factor weighing on Sydneyâ€™s market is tighter credit, as regulators force banks to cut back on the riskiest mortgages. Fewer interest-only loans â€” which are cheaper in the early years because borrowers donâ€™t repay principal â€” means Sydney prices are now out of reach for many investors. Chinese buyers, a previous driver of demand, have also receded due to difficulties in moving cash from the mainland. For Australian borrowers, thereâ€™s little prospect of relief for household income as wage growth has stagnated for the past five years. The economyâ€™s private debt-to-income ratio is also at a record 189%, leaving little scope to increase leverage anyway. Meanwhile, high-income owner-occupiers have less borrowing power due to tighter checks on their real spending levels as part of the mortgage approval process. Previously they could rely on benchmarks that were unrealistically low. Market bulls point to Australiaâ€™s population growth and record-low interest rates â€” unchanged at 1.5% for almost two years â€” as reasons to expect a soft landing in the property market. Others suggest the current downturn is only just getting started, noting the decline after 2003 lasted for more than two years.

Today, in an age of affluence not even the Astors and Vanderbilts might have imagined, there is something closer to a List of 55. Its members are so rich that, in rarefied corners of Wall Street, they seem less like actual people than vast investment empires. Their ranks include familiar names like Bezos and Dell, as well as a growing number of lesser lights whose dynastic wealth is reshaping global business, if not capitalism itself. This unofficial list represents the first, rough cut of the most sought-after banking clients at JPMorgan Chase & Co, and it is by no means complete. To the contrary: The List of 55 is only the beginning. Around the globe, bankers are vying for the worldâ€™s hyper-wealthy as never before. And they are holding out investments that are tantalizingly off-limits to the rest of us, behind a velvet rope of bespoke investment banking. This is how the super-rich keep getting super-richer. Anyone can buy stocks. Only a privileged few can bankroll multimillion-dollar ventures or buy entire companies. Private equity â€” that lucrative and, at times, controversial force of modern finance â€” has become a playground of the new aristocracy. It was bound to happen. Like so many things, investing is becoming increasingly stratified. Private bankers now say that entry-class â€œrichâ€ starts at about US$25 million. But you need more than that â€” typically at least 40 times more, or about US$1 billion â€” if you want a ticket into serious deal-making. Yet, on another level, the rich-ification of private equity harks back to another time. This era of extreme wealth and extreme inequality is minting private dynasties that rival public corporations. On Wall Street, many executives expect the billionaire-whisperers, like merchant bankers of old, to accrue even more financial power. Some of the people who tend these family fortunes say privately that bankers can seem irrelevant. They say their success doesnâ€™t hinge on the banks. The worn-out trope â€” this is a new Gilded Age â€” may not be far off. Not since the days of John D. Rockefeller has so much been owned by so few. â€œThis is a new world thatâ€™s been around, basically, forever,â€ said David Dwek, head of private sponsors at Morgan Stanley. â€œThey are an important part of the deal ecosystem.â€ Wealthy families have always been choice clients for bankers. Today, major banks woo billionaires and their family offices much the way they do multinational corporations or deep-pocketed institutional investors. Services range from advising on mergers and acquisitions to arranging financing for portfolio companies to providing counsel on expanding or selling family businesses. Around the globe, bankers are vying for the worldâ€™s hyper-wealthy as never before Granted, investing is a risky business, even for billionaires. The recent implosion of Steinhoff International Holdings NV, for instance, cost the South African tycoon Christo Wiese, the companyâ€™s biggest shareholder, the equivalent of more than US$3 billion in net worth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Banks that lent Wiese money against his stock have lost roughly US$1 billion. Still, with so much money and influence at stake, bankers are pitching hard. Goldman Sachs Group Inc has its own list of 60, counting among its clients the Reimann familyâ€™s JAB Holding Co and the Koch brothersâ€™ investment firm. JPMorgan, in addition to its initial 55, is watching several hundred families that are poised to enter this rarefied realm. Credit Suisse Group AG, which has retreated from wealth management for less-well-heeled customers, reserves its ultimate white-glove treatment for about 200 moneyed individuals and clans. Deutsche Bank AG and UBS Group AG have separate units that bridge private wealth management and investment banking. At Morgan Stanley, Dwekâ€™s team targets â€œpermanent capital,â€ or money from families, sovereign wealth funds, pension systems and listed investment companies. The operation began about eight years ago as part of an effort to pull wealthy families into Morgan Stanleyâ€™s orbit. Over at JPMorgan, bankers in April arranged financing for an acquisition of Texas-based food company C.H. Guenther & Son by PPC Partners. The investment company is controlled by the Pritzker family, one of Americaâ€™s richest clans. Paul Carbone leads PPC with Tony Pritzker, and together they focus on North American companies valued between US$100 million and US$750 million. Carbone, formerly managing partner of the private-equity group at Robert W. Baird & Co, said PPC doesnâ€™t rely on bank-led auctions to source most of its deals. Rather, banks tend to serve as intermediaries and pitch firms such as PPC to business owners looking to sell or expand. The banksâ€™ goal, as he put it: â€œto put people together who have like interests, in a very old-world sort of way.â€ â€œWeâ€™re trying to reach people where theyâ€™re most passionateâ€ Credit Suisse, which has also advised PPC, went as far as to organize an event in Detroit to nurture ties with Daniel Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans Inc, and other super-affluent types. (Gilbert, who co-hosted the event, is worth more than US$7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.) Representatives of 43 families worth a combined US$75 billion attended the May 2017 event. The official topic was revitalizing Detroit. If Credit Suisse drummed up business, so much the better. Credit Suisse was already financing mortgage originations for Quicken Loans. But the bank sees its relationship with Gilbert as valuable even beyond his company, said Charles Buckley, head of ultra-high net worth coverage for North America. â€œWeâ€™re trying to reach people where theyâ€™re most passionate,â€ Buckley said. â€œSometimes thatâ€™s in traditional investment-banking ways, but sometimes itâ€™s not. Sometimes itâ€™s helping them revitalize Detroit.â€ Buckley now oversees a US$3 billion portfolio of loans made chiefly against billionairesâ€™ stakes in private companies, as well as a team of 20 bankers. â€œIt could be a block trade one day, and they may want to tap into public markets another,â€ said Shideh Theunissen, Buckleyâ€™s lieutenant. Itâ€™s almost impossible to put a specific number on the money thatâ€™s at stake. The Pritzkersâ€™ PPC Partners, Paul Allenâ€™s Vulcan and Stone Canyon Industries, backed by Michael Milken, are among the more recognizable names. Many others fly under the radar. And not all billionaires are looking to acquire companies or take stakes in private ventures. Still, activity has been heating up, particularly in middle-market transactions. The value of deals done by family offices jumped to US$100.6 billion in 2016, from US$25.1 billion five years earlier, according to PitchBook data. Private bankers now say that entry-class â€œrichâ€ starts at about US$25 million. But you need more than that if you want a ticket into serious deal-making. Major banks must compete with an established cast of specialized boutiques. Byron Trott, known for his long-term links to Warren Buffett, caters to the worldâ€™s wealthy; his firm, BDT Capital Partners, has used its connections to raise billions for private-equity funds. One of the grand old names in banking, Rothschild & Co, has also been expanding lately, with an eye toward the ultra-rich. It helped the Koch brothers finance Meredith Corpâ€™s takeover of Time Inc last year. Another boutique, Moelis & Co, has won the favor of hedge fund manager-turned-Sears Chief Executive Officer Edward Lampert, as well as casino mogul Steve Wynn. Aryeh Bourkoffâ€™s LionTree Advisors works closely with the tycoon John Malone. Major banks want to bring good deals to family offices, partly to avoid losing business to the boutiques and middle-market investment banks, said Bill Woodson, who leads Citi Private Bankâ€™s family-office group in North America. Woodsonâ€™s unit, with four private bankers and two investment bankers, shepherds large family offices looking to make deals from one area of the bank to another. Bigger banks still are trying to adjust to the new realities. Over the years, even as rich lists exploded, many large global banks became so fragmented that billionaires simply outgrew them and hired their own investment professionals. In the past, many bankers were so focused on corporate clients and other big institutional investors that they largely ignored individual fortunes. Investment bankers might even drop a billionaireâ€™s family office as a client, figuring that pitching deals to it wasnâ€™t worth the hassle. No more. â€œFrom our perspective, theyâ€™re No. 1 or No. 2 on a call list,â€ said Todd Stevens, head of the key client partners business at Deutsche Bank.', '6/12/2018 3:19', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Management focused mainly on the recent acquisition of Genaxis (51% subsidiary) and Innovation Associates Consulting (IAC) (60% subsidiary via Genaxis). According to management, IAC has the edge when it comes to government contracts as it is cheaper but tends to fall short in the private sector given the lack of global experience. Nevertheless, IAC received the contract to implement 1GFMAS (Government Financial and Management Accounting System) valued at RM151.4 million for three years. Besides that, Genaxis has a current order book of RM20 million, and is aggressively bidding for other contracts in the public and private sectors. We believe DNeXâ€™s position as a government service provider is enhanced by the acquisition of the two consulting firms. Management revealed that 30%-owned Ping Petroleum is diversifying its asset base. We understand that Ping will begin development of its Avalon greenfield located in the North Sea, offshore Ireland. Additionally, the group is bidding for additional exploration fields in the North Sea. Furthermore, Ping has begun bidding for an additional brownfield similar to Anasuria after losing the bid for a similar brownfield asset last year. Despite the large expected capital expenditure required, DNeX intends to request Ping to pay out dividends, given strong cash flows from the Anasuria operations. Note that Anasuriaâ€™s cash flows are directly linked to crude oil price, and oil production is expected to increase after the maintenance activities carried out in financial year 2017 (FY17). DNeX announced that it would provide connectivity between the existing vehicle entry permit (VEP) system and TnG. The contract is expected to generate revenue of RM19 million to RM21 million per annum with a gross profit margin of around 35%. We understand that the RFID tag is currently encrypted on foreign vehicles entering Malaysia. However, going forward, we believe the goal is to equip all local vehicles with the RFID tag and collect toll payments via RFID. Additionally, DNeX is the sole supplier for this service in Malaysia given its link to the VEP. That said, the new governmentâ€™s promise to abolish tolls may result in some downside risk. On the other hand, management revealed that the subcontract via Bukti Megah to rehire foreign workers has ended. OGPC Sdn Bhd secured a contract to supply portable container systems (PCS) to Petro Teguh last year. Management noted that delivery is way behind schedule and shared that only seven systems were delivered in FY17 whilst one was delivered in the first quarter of FY18. It still expects to deliver around 50 units in FY18 and the remainder in FY19. We note that a contract tenure extension is likely, given the delays on-site. DNeX revealed that the delays were mainly due to on-site dealers taking longer than expected to meet regulatory requirements. DNeX is working closely with Petro Teguh to rectify the problems at the various installation sites. Note that DNeXâ€™s task under the contract is only to supply the PCS. Therefore, we believe that DNeX will not incur any penalties for the delays. DNeXâ€™s long-term outlook seems secure on the back of its Sealnet (previously known as 1Trade) trade facilitation system and development of Avalon field by Ping Petroleum. â€” TA Securities Research, June 11', '6/12/2018 3:00', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The three-month â€œtax-freeâ€ period will no doubt be a boost to short-term earnings, but it does not address the structural problems facing the industry. We believe BTotoâ€™s revenue was cut by 2% under the previous GST regime, as the company absorbed the cost instead of passing this on to its customers. The impact on BToto to its bottom line was more significant at around -20% a year. However, we are of the view that the new SST regime could still expand to include number forecast operators (NFOs), as they contributed around RM150 million in GST based on our estimates, and this inclusion would also not have any direct impact on consumers. Hence, the higher profitability is only likely to last for the three months (June to August) before the SST is reintroduced in September. The decline in NFOsâ€™ revenue is a structural problem due to the more attractive payouts from illegal operators, and we believe the zero-rated GST will be help resolve the problem. We believe that operators could have tweaked the payout to pass on the impact of the GST, but the widening of the current payout difference (against illegal operators), at around 28%, could cause a significant dip in revenue. Unless there is a step-up in enforcement, or an increase in payout (which we think is unlikely for now), the problem is likely to persist, in which case the NFOs might not be able to enjoy the full benefit of the improving consumer sentiment. As we are not expecting the benefits from the tax holiday to last beyond the three-month period, we are keeping our dividend discount model-based TP unchanged at RM2.20, but downgrading our call to â€œsellâ€ from â€œholdâ€ due to the recent run-up in share price post the announcement. Upside risks include the no further taxes implemented on BToto and increased enforcement against illegal betting operators. â€” Affin Hwang Capital Research, June 11', '6/12/2018 2:56', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Lower catch rates led to higher imports required to support surimi production. As weather conditions are showing meaningful improvement, management is hopeful for better fishing yields that could return margins to healthier levels. This could be further supported by the recently commissioned new surimi plants in Hutan Melintang. In FY17, PBT margins registered at 16.7% as opposed to 13.7% in FY18. With the coming 2020 Tokyo Olympics, management mulls potential collaborations to support an anticipated surge in demand there, which could boost FY20. With its around 60% prime age profile, management is hopeful for an around 15% growth in the fresh fruit bunch (FFB) yields. In the medium term, around 30% of the plantation portfolio which is of a younger age category is poised to contribute further to FFB output. Management anticipates crude palm oil prices to trail between RM2,350 per tonne and RM2,450 per tonne for FY19. This is in line with our in-house expectation of RM2,400 per tonne on average for 2018. The egg market in Peninsular Malaysia is overcrowded as egg producers continue to scale up production. In the integrated livestock farming recent results, its Indonesian performance was dampened by poorer broiler contributions. Going forward, management expects its other markets (that is, Sabah and Sarawak, and Vietnam) to remain stable. Hence, the expanded Vietnam poultry layer unit and feed mills are expected to contribute favourably to the group. On the latest count, FamilyMart has opened 49 new stores, on track with FY18â€™s target. Management earmarks to open another 50 stores in FY19 towards their FY22 target of 300 stores. While operations are not expected to break even in FY19, management expects the store chain to become profitable in FY20 from an expected store base of around 120 branches. We continue to remain optimistic about the delivery of top-line growth amid challenges in certain sectors. This is partly thanks to the groupâ€™s well-diversified base and regional exposure. While heavy investments are geared mainly for longer-term gain under its five-year plan, the groupâ€™s market leading position should keep the company relevant amid a highly competitive landscape. However, we leave our assumptions unchanged as we believe the above-mentioned merits have been sufficiently accounted for in our estimates. Our valuation is based on an unchanged 29 times FY19 price-earning ratio. The ascribed valuation is in line with the groupâ€™s three-year mean, following a strong buying rally across the consumer space. While the group has strong fundamentals, we believe most of the positives may be already priced into its rich valuations. Furthermore, the low dividend prospects may cause yield-seeking investors to look elsewhere. Risks to our call include significant improvement to MPM sales, a significant uptick in palm oil prices and sales volume, and better-than-expected demand of poultry products abroad. â€” Kenanga Research, June 11', '6/12/2018 2:57', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Operational since 2009 and strategically located near the international shipping lanes in the vicinity of Singapore, the two terminals have a total storage capacity of 647,000 cubic metres (cu m) and are currently fully utilised on term contracts.Â Â Dialog also wholly owns the equity interests in Langsat Terminal (Three) Sdn Bhd (LGT 3), which acquired two parcels of lease land and a 100,000 cu m tank terminal in Tanjung Langsat, Johor, in March 2018 for further capacity expansion. Â As LGT 3 can support the development of another 300,000 cu mÂ of storage capacity, Dialogâ€™s total tank terminal storage capacity in Tanjung Langsat could expand by 40% to one million cu m.

Â We estimate that the acquisition, which translates into a price-earnings ratio (PER) of nine times, could add RM9 million or 2% to Dialogâ€™s financial year 2019 (FY19) earnings. As the increase will be insignificant to the group, our forecasts are unchanged for now. Meanwhile, the main valuation rerating catalyst for the group stems from its Pengerang Deepwater Terminal (PDT) project.

Â Earlier this year, the group signed a memorandum of understanding with the Johor state government to develop PDT Phase 3. Dialog trades at an FY19 PER of 36 times, below its five-year peak of 46 times. We view its higher-than-peer premium as justified given Dialogâ€™s long-term recurring cash flow-generating businesses, which are largely cushioned from volatile crude oil price cycles, and further underpinned by the Pengerang developmentâ€™s multi-year value rerating bonanza together with a healthy balance sheet. â€” AmImvestment Bank, June 11', '6/12/2018 2:58', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

In comparison, a similar research done by Nielsen in 2015 found that attitudes towards the GST introduction were less optimistic, with over half of Malaysians (58%) then believing the tax would be good for the economy. â€œWhile Malaysians were initially tentative towards the introduction of the GST three years ago when the tax was first announced, having experienced the effects of the GST over the past three years, they appear to welcome the move to effectively eliminate the tax, perhaps due to the gradual increase in the cost of goods and services that has occurred since its implementation as reflected in the Consumer Price Index,â€ said Nielsen Malaysia managing director Raphael Pereda in a statement. The survey showed that over half of consumers (57%) expect the prices of goods and services to decrease following the â€œzerorisationâ€ of the GST, while one-third (33%) believe that prices will remain at current levels. According to Pereda, this may mean consumer spending intentions will rise, which could result in increased sales for manufacturers and retailers. The data showed that two out of three consumers (69%) expect their purchase habits to change following the GST reduction, with close to one-third (30%) saying that they would spend more money on essential items, such as apparel and clothing, perishable foods, non-perishable foods and baby products. The survey also showed Malaysiansâ€™ willingness to increase their spending on non-essential purchases such as holidays or leisure trips (33%), new property (27%) and out-of-home entertainment (26%). One in four consumers (25%) said they will be able to channel their money towards paying off debts with the zero-rating of the GST. â€œMany retailers had been providing consumers with discounts even before the zero-rated GST was officially implemented to encourage consumers not to postpone their festive spending to after June 1, 2018. â€œIf these value-for-money promotions continue, we can expect to see an increase in sales volume compared with previous years,â€ said Pereda. The Nielsen survey also showed that 77% of the respondents view the governmentâ€™s initiative to fix the price of fuel as being â€œgood for consumersâ€, while an overwhelming nine out of 10 believe that tolls would either be removed or reduced. â€œIt is clear that the recent policy announcements made by the government have gained the approval of a vast majority of Malaysians.

To recap, Pharmaniaga has held exclusive rights since 1994 under a concession agreement (CA) to purchase a list of medical products under the MoHâ€™s approved product purchase list (APPL) from suppliers selected by the MoH, and distribute them to medical institutions under the MoHâ€™s jurisdiction. Under the CA, Pharmaniaga procures medical products at prices which have been predetermined by the MoH with its suppliers. It sells these products to the MoH at a fixed percentage markup over its purchase prices to cover its cost of inventory holding, distribution and potential inventory obsolescence. The CA was last renewed in 2009 for a period of 10 years, which will expire by November 2019. Through a tender exercise (every three years), the MoH selects the suppliers of products for the APPL based on its own product specifications and criteria. While Pharmaniaga does organise these tender exercises under the CA, we understand that it does not play any part in the selection of suppliers by the MoH. Pharmaniagaâ€™s own manufacturing segment also participates in these tenders. As of financial year 2017 (FY17), revenue from the CA made up 49% of Pharmaniagaâ€™s revenue, and was fully reflected under the logistics and distribution (L&D) segment (68.3% of FY17 revenue). In our view, margins for the CA business are thin given that the earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) margin for the overall L&D segment was 1.2% in FY17. Note that the L&D divisionâ€™s FY17 Ebit only made up 17.7% of the groupâ€™s total FY17 Ebit, with the remainder generated by its manufacturing segment (69.3%) and Indonesia operations (13%). According to media reports, the MoHâ€™s budget for medical products was at around RM3.3 billion in the L&D segment (68.3% of FY17 revenue). We estimate that only 33.4% of the MoHâ€™s budget was used for the purchase of medical products under the APPL given that Pharmaniaga is the sole supplier under the CA. We believe the remaining budget of RM2.2 billion was used to purchase drugs which fall out of the APPL list, likely through central contracts and direct purchases. Overall, we maintain our earnings estimates, â€œaddâ€ call and 12-month TP of RM4.55. This is still based on 15.9 times calendar year 2019 price-earnings ratio, a 10% discount to CIMBâ€™s pharmaceutical sector five-year target mean. Its dividend yields of 5.4% to 7.2% (FY18 to FY20) should also appeal to investors. Downside risks include lower-than-expected demand for drugs from the MoH and discontinuation of the CA. â€” CGSCIMB Research, June 11', '6/12/2018 2:53', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The major sub-sectors which registered increases in April 2018 were: Electrical and electronic equipment products (6.6%), petroleum, chemical, rubber and plastic products (3%), and non-metallic mineral products, basic metals and fabricated metal products (4.7%). â€œThe mining sector output recorded an increase of 1.8% in April 2018 compared with the same period of the previous year. This was due to an increase in the crude oil index (4.4%),â€ the department said. Meanwhile, the Natural Gas Index declined by 0.4% and the electricity output grew by 5.8% in April 2018 after recording an increase of 4.4% in March 2018. Overall, Nomura Global Markets Research, in a note yesterday, said the pickup in April IPI growth is consistent with its view that second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth will likely be supported by government spending around the general election, the return of fuel subsidies and the zero-rating of the goods and services tax (GST) in June. Looking into the third quarter, Nomura said that the boost to private consumption is likely to be modest and is unlikely to offset the hit to growth from significant government spending cuts to offset the loss in GST revenue. In a note yesterday, CIMB Research said the manufacturing recovery in Malaysia in April was broadly in line with the rebound regionally, including in Singapore, Thailand and South Korea. However, the positive external momentum that has underpinned growth in the manufacturing sector thus far, is expected to weaken, as demand from major economies and global electronics cycle normalises. â€œMoreover, we expect the governmentâ€™s cost rationalisation drive through operating expenditure cuts and cancellation of infrastructure projects to dampen investment growth, offsetting the expansionary effects on household spending from the goods and services tax (GST) cut, fuel subsidies and welfare transfers,â€ said CIMB Research, hence, maintaining its 2018 GDP growth forecast at 5.2%, below the Bloomberg consensus of 5.5%. Going forward, MIDF Research foresees IPI performances to expand at steady pace for the second half of 2018 amid escalating trade tension, moderating inflation and supportive policy changes for businesses such as zero-rated GST and stabilised retail fuel prices. Plus, MIDF Research expects the encouraging IPI growth trend in 2017 to continue in 2018 supported by robust external trade performance and gradual increase in commodity price to boost up the industrial activity in Malaysia. Brent crude oil price average at US$76.70 (RM306.03), up by 49.2% y-o-y in May, said MIDF Research, noting that the strong rise in commodity prices is due to strengthening global demand and continuous efforts of oil production limit among most oil-producing countries. â€œLower business cost partly due to moderating inflation, stable retail fuel prices and zero-rated GST will provide additional supports for industrial production growth to hit 4.3% in 2018,â€ said MIDF Research, in a note yesterday. Nevertheless, MIDF Research said headwinds from global trade tension could pose possible threat to the estimate.', '6/12/2018 2:32', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Through the online platform, RHB targets to approve RM100 million in SME loans over the course of one year. Yesterday, RHB launched its pilot run focusing on SMEs in the Klang Valley. It will introduce the platform nationwide by the third quarter of this year. The RHB SME Financing offers SME term loans with a minimum tenure of six months up to 24 months, for disbursements of between RM50,000 and RM300,000. It is eligible for businesses with an annual turnover of less than RM35 million. The online loan application only requires two documents to be uploaded, and it provides a loan simulator to help customers calculate their affordability. Application tracking can also be done via the platform. â€œOne thing that SMEs are looking for is simplicity. They find that banks are a bit complicated; they are unsure of how to do the submission and they donâ€™t have clarity as to where exactly are their applications.

The company is looking to submit the plan by August, way before the February 2019 deadline, Lim told reporters after the groupâ€™s annual general meeting yesterday. Currently, he said the company is finalising the appointment of the principal adviser and is discussing with stakeholders and bondholders to work out the plan.

Though the FBM KLCI surged by 1.25% to 1,777 points last Wednesday, spurred by the Nasdaq index booking a third record high during the week, foreign selling inched higher to RM134.2 million net on the same day, Adam noted, amid the announcement of populist policies by Italyâ€™s new government in the wake of the European Central Bankâ€™s plan to end its quantitative easing programme. â€œThe level of attrition thereafter swelled to near the RM300 million net level on (last) Thursday and (last) Friday as investors geared up for the G7 (Group of Seven) meeting, where a risk of trade war was renewed with France and Canada threatening retaliatory duties in response to US levies. â€œLast weekâ€™s abating outflows brought the year-to-date (YTD) outflow from Malaysia to US$757.6 million net or RM3.02 billion net,â€ he said. Adam said this is still the lowest among its Asean peers that MIDF Research monitors, namely Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia.

Edmund Goh, an Asia fixed-income investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, says heâ€™s planning to take more trips to China to get intelligence thatâ€™s hard to gain from afar. Investors can get to see among others, people who work in risk departments at banks, who can tell them how theyâ€™re classifying loans, he said. Or corporate treasury executives who may shed some light on their use of shadow banking financing. â€œIf you do field trips, you can meet people other than those investor relations staff,â€ said Goh, who is based in Singapore, where a flight to China takes about six hours. â€œEven though you canâ€™t get a full picture, at least you will have enough pieces of the puzzle to help you make a sound decision.â€ With foreign holdings in the worldâ€™s third-biggest bond market at a record high, the stakes are rising. Investors have been rattled by a lack of corporate financial transparency as rising funding costs from a deleveraging campaign spur a surge in defaults.

Industry coalition Padi Rescue coordinator Norfitri Amir Muhammad said trust and transparency could be reinstated with the revival of the National Rice and Paddy Board (LPN) that can establish a fund from the profit earned from rice imports to help farmers. â€œAs it stands, our study shows that monopoly holder Padiberas Nasional Bhd (Bernas) earns a profit margin of RM700 per tonne from the imported rice. Imagine what their profit must be like? â€œIf the LPN is revived with the participation of farmers, it will be an independent body made up by people who know the sector. Profit from imports [of rice] could go into the fund to help the sector in emergencies like disease-ridden plants and floods,â€ he told a media conference yesterday. Norfitri said the problem cannot be solved with just the appointment of a group of companies handling the imports because it does not resolve the low demand for local rice. â€œFarmers donâ€™t have the bargaining power to ask for good prices. This sector is not one that should be seen as a profit-making sector. The subsidy for padi is about RM2.2 billion but who benefits? â€œThe contract holders for fertilisers or insecticides mark up the prices. The government must review these contracts because it [can] save money here. So we should not be looking at Bernas only but at every level, hence the need for the LPN (which was first set up in the 1970s),â€ he added. Last week, Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Minister Salahuddin Ayub announced the termination of tycoon Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhariâ€™s Bernasâ€™ rice import monopoly. Bernas took over from the LPN in 1996 and was listed a year later on Bursa Malaysia before it was taken private. In 2011, its concession to import rice was extended for another 10 years until 2021. However, as part of the Pakatan Harapan governmentâ€™s manifesto to break Bernasâ€™ monopoly, a working paper with ministry feedback and other stakeholders is being drafted to be submitted to the government for further action. According to a study by the Malay Economic Action Council (MTEM), an umbrella body representing 47 Malay non-governmental organisations, local rice farmers milled 1.82 billion tonnes of rice last year, and up to 900,000 tonnes of rice were imported by Bernas, mostly from Vietnam, to meet the shortfall of 2.75 billion tonnes for consumption in Malaysia. Malaysia imports 30% of rice. Norfitri said Malaysian farmers are able to make up to 100% of local demand but due to bad management of the industry, including weak seeds because of a lack of research and development, and high costs of fertilisers and insecticides. Padi Rescue is an organisation of farmers under the MTEM. Local farmer Azhar Hashim, 50, said a government subsidy of RM2,000 per hectare is high, but farmers still experience losses because of alleged discrepancies in the sector like the sale of insecticides at RM90 a bottle compared with RM40 in countries like Thailand.', '6/12/2018 2:19', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Definitely, said real estate agent Janet Chong of Hartamas Real Estate (OUG) Sdn Bhd. To her, the move to change the name is â€œirrationalâ€. â€œOne of the main reasons, properties in Bangsar South have been selling very well over the past few years was because of its successful branding,â€ she told EdgeProp.my said. Located along the Federal Highway, the gleaming buildings of Bangsar South was developed on what was previously Kampung Kerinchi, an old settlement of urban pioneers. One of Lembah Pantai MP Fahmi Fadzilâ€™s election promises was to revert to its original name, citing its historical significance. Â Chong who specialises in properties in the area shared her experience of clients who had pulled out of a deal when they found that a particular projectâ€™s address in the area was not Bangsar South. â€œThere are many investors here because Bangsar South is a popular business hub close to Kuala Lumpur city centre. â€œMany foreign expats and companies select a place based on the address, especially when they are unable to be in Malaysia to look at the place. The fact is, Bangsar South is now more well-known than Kerinchi,â€ Chong noted. She added that if the name change happens now, it will dampen the already soft property market in Bangsar South. She said the Bangsar South rental market for instance, has softened as more new projects are completed in the vicinity. â€œCan you imagine what would happen if Bangsar South is renamed to Kerinchi?â€ On the other hand, Fernstate Sdn Bhd director Shawn Fernandez believes there will not be much of an impact on property prices if the name is changed. â€œI personally donâ€™t think it will have a detrimental impact to the prices of the properties in Bangsar South just because the name is changed to Kerinchi,â€ said Fernandez. He noted that most property investors and buyers consider the investibility and liveability of a property and not just its name. â€œIf you look from the investment point of view and if you talk to property buyers, they will be more concerned with things like whether it is a good area to live in, whether connectivity is good and whether there are amenities present in that area,â€ he said. He cited the example of the affluent area of Damansara Heights. â€œIn the 1980s, the area was called Damansara Heights. Later, it was changed to Bukit Damansara. Did it impact the property prices there? I donâ€™t think so,â€ he said. â€œWho knows, 10 years later Kampung Kerinchi will be so fashionable and everyone wants to live there? Of course, the marketing and sales people will say that it helps to have a â€˜Westernâ€™ or a more appealing name and I do not disagree with them but in terms of how much priority and weightage is given to the name of the area, it is not that significant compared with other factors which I mentioned earlier,â€ he added. Nevertheless, Fernandez felt that it is better to leave the name of the place as it is. Meanwhile, Reapfield Group chief operating officer Jonathan Lee expects to see property prices and transactions in the area to be stagnant for now until the market has a clearer picture of what the name change entails and the implications that will follow. â€œAlthough I donâ€™t think the name Bangsar South was justified to be the name of the area in the first place, it was helpful to investors for that period of time. â€œBut now, if there is a name change, as an investor, I will shy away from that area for a while and wait to see what happens,â€ he said.', '6/11/2018 4:38', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Apart from the obvious North Asian and US equities that may be impacted by the outcome of President Donald Trump and North Korea Supreme Leader Kim Jong Unâ€™s meeting, thereâ€™s another geography investors can consider: Singapore. Its consumer stocks to be precise. The city-stateâ€™s Sentosa Island will host the historic summit Tuesday, where Trump aims to persuade the North Korean dictator to give up his countryâ€™s nuclear arsenal in exchange for relief from US economic sanctions. While heightened security during the event could disrupt both tourist and local spending, hotels and restaurants still stand to benefit from the sheer number of visitors, and positive sentiment could spill over into the medium term, some analysts say. The event should generate â€œa hoohahâ€ in Singapore, and â€œtourism as well as the consumer sector will likely see a liftâ€ thanks to the influx of international media, said Jarick Seet, head of small- and mid-cap research at RHB Research Institute Singapore Pte Ltd. Shares of Shangri-La Asia Ltd, which trades in Singapore and Hong Kong, advanced last week as more summit details emerged, including Singaporeâ€™s public order establishing a special zone around its flagship hotel for the summit. The event is scheduled to take place at the Capella hotel in Sentosa, which also houses Genting Singapore Ltdâ€™s Resort World Sentosa integrated resort. Hereâ€™s a look at the consumer shares that might stand to benefit from the event: Hotels: Shangri-La Asia, Genting Singapore, Hotel Properties Ltd, Amara Holdings Ltd, CDL Hospitality Trusts, Far East Hospitality Trust, Ascott Residence Trust, OUE Hospitality Trust could be impacted. These companies own hotels in Singapore popular with business travelers. Food & Beverage: Jumbo Group Ltd, No Signboard Holdings Ltd have some of the most iconic seafood restaurants in Singapore, while Kimly Ltd and BreadTalk Group Ltd are homegrown brands with stores across the island. Transport: ComfortDelGro Corp owns Singaporeâ€™s largest taxi fleet. With thousands of visitors likely to be in town for the summit, itâ€™s inevitable that cabs will be in high demand. Singapore Airlines Ltd, Southeast Asiaâ€™s biggest airline, and SATS Ltd, provider of food solutions and services to the aviation sector, also stand to gain amid an influx of travelers for the event. Oversea-Chinese Banking Corpâ€™s head of research Carmen Lee is skeptical the event will benefit local equities. â€œThe summit is so short, it is unlikely to have any real impact on consumer stocks in June,â€ she said. As some areas have been gazetted off, with stricter security measures, â€œit could be a slight negative,â€ she said. Lim Siew Khee, an analyst at CIMB-GK Securities Pte Ltd, shares the view that the summit will probably boost consumer and tourism-related stocks in the medium term as it sets the stage for such events in the future.

It has benefited from an historic deal between Opec and other producers to cut output, supporting an oil price rally thatâ€™s been reinforced by increasing geopolitical tensions this year.Yet the recovery still has much more to run, according to Chief Investment Officer Espen Westeren.US shale production has made a spectacular comeback, but is capped by insufficient pipeline capacity. And weâ€™re only now starting to see the negative impact on global output of oil companiesâ€™ dramatic spending cuts from 2014 to 2017, Westeren said.â€œIf investments donâ€™t rise substantially, weâ€™ll have a problem,â€ he said in a June 6 phone interview. â€œThereâ€™s a good probabilityâ€ that oil prices will return to US$100 (RM398) a barrel within a couple of years, he added.Titan is betting that bottlenecks affecting the Permian region, the most prolific US shale oil area, will boost pipeline companies such as Energy Transfer Partners LP and Energy Transfer Equity LP, which now make up about 10 per cent of the fundâ€™s assets.Itâ€™s also shifting positions in offshore drilling, cutting its holding in Oslo-listed Borr Drilling Ltd. by more than half since the third quarter. While Borr was still the fundâ€™s biggest asset at the end of April, Titan has now also established an ownership stake in Transocean Ltd and Fredriksenâ€™s new rig company Northern Drilling Ltd, while boosting investments in Ensco Plc bonds.The Philadelphia Oil Service Sector Index, which includes Transocean and Schlumberger Ltd, still hasnâ€™t recovered after halving from a high in 2014 and is trailing Norwegian oil-service stocks.â€œIt will soon be clear to the market that thereâ€™s a recovery also in offshore capital expenditure,â€ Westeren said. â€œWeâ€™ll then get a repricing of a lot of offshore-related investments, whether thatâ€™s bonds in large US offshore drillers or equity in drillers, supply-vessel companies or subsea construction.â€Titan is also betting on shipping, where the amount of ordered vessels as a portion of the global fleet is at the lowest level since the 1990s, Westeren said. After a 10-year slump, thatâ€™s a â€œvery interesting setup for an up-cycle,â€ Westeren said.In May, the firm started Titan Credit Fund with capital of US$20 million, mostly from existing Titan investors. It aims to generate annual returns in the â€œmid-teens,â€ lower than the Opportunities fundâ€™s ambition of 30 per cent and with a longer time horizon. Titan hopes to attract more capital to both funds, Westeren said.The 39-year-old Norwegian managed Fredriksenâ€™s private investments from 2010 to 2015. Westeren and Fredriksen have since had a conflict over the former traderâ€™s bonuses. An arbitration court is yet to consider the matter. Westeren declined to comment. â€” Bloomberg', '6/11/2018 2:36', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The last four quarters (2QFY17 to 1QFY18) came in below expectations, mostly due to higher-than-expected costs, compressing margins, with 4QFY17 falling to all-time low with a loss of RM4.4 million (as per FY17 Bursa announcement dated Feb 27, 2018). Although there has been a reprieve since 4QFY17â€™s low earnings, Tomypak may not be out of the woods just yet. Its 1QFY18 CNP margin was at 2.1%, a far cry from FY17 CNP margin of 5.7%, FY16â€™s of 9%, and FY15â€™s of 10.8%. The margin compression began mainly from 2QFY17 onwards on higher raw-material costs and factory overheads. Notably, Tomypak plans to increase capacity up to 36,000 tonnes by FY20-FY21, incurring additional costs while also grappling with higher raw-material-cost environment likely brought about by higher resin and printing ink costs. We expect capacity to increase gradually up to 36,000 tonnes per annum by FY20-FY21 (from about 25,000 tonnes per annum in FY17) upon completion of a new plant in Senai. Phase 1 of the capacity expansion will come on stream from second half of FY17 (2HFY17) to 1HFY18, while Phase 2 and 3 will see capacity growing gradually from FY20 onwards. Post the recent results, we cut earnings estimates by 41%-35% for FY18-FY19. Considering the higher costs in recent quarters, we are expecting FY18-FY19 CNP margin estimates of 3.6%-4.1%, which are lower than in FY17. We are comfortable with our margin assumptions for now, but may consider revising up our earnings should there be better cost management and margin improvements in the coming quarters. We maintain our effective tax-rate assumptions of 13%-20% for FY18-FY19 on expectations of tax incentives from capacity expansion plans. Tomypakâ€™s FY18-FY19 net dividend per share estimates of 1.2 sen-1.6 sen imply 1.5%-2% yields. Our TP is based on 1 times price-to-book value (PBV) on FY19 fully diluted book value of equity per share estimate of 0.51 times (-2.0 standard deviation to the five-year average) as stable earnings and profitability remain uncertain. Note that we switch our valuation method to PBV (from price-earnings ratio due to earnings volatility in light of persistent missed earnings expectations over four quarters. Our valuations are based on FY19 as we believe this better encapsulates Tomypakâ€™s value once the bulk of Phase 1 expansion is completed. We believe valuations are stretched warranting an â€œunderperformâ€ call as we have priced in most positives, including Tomypakâ€™s bullish expansion plans +44% up to FY20-FY21, as well as accounting for weakness from margin compressions, while the near-term outlook for earnings stability remains challenging. As such, we opt to be conservative with our valuations, but may upgrade our earnings and valuations upon more concrete margin improvements. â€” Kenanga Research, June 8', '6/11/2018 2:20', -1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Operationally, the business has achieved a significant efficiency improvement â€” its rejection rate improved to 15%, from 40% in the first quarter of FY17 (1QFY17). Omia targets to reduce the rejection rate to 10% by early FY19. About 74% of its FY17 alloy wheel revenue was derived from the original equipment manufacturing (OEM) market, mainly driven by the supply for Perodua models: Bezza, Axia, and Myvi standard variants. Omia recently bagged a contract to supply wheels for the new Perodua sport utility vehicle (SUV), slated for launch at end-2018. This new contract should lift Omia production volume by 12,000 units/month to 47,000 units/month (close to the break-even level of 50,000 units/month). Omia is also looking to expand the OEM customer base through active engagement with Proton and Honda. Internationally, Germany is Omiaâ€™s key export market. In May 2017, the group signed a cost-plus agreement with China-based CITIC Dicastal, the worldâ€™s largest alloy wheel maker that commands about 23% market share globally and 45% market share in China. Under the agreement, CITIC Dicastal will utilise about 50% of Omiaâ€™s capacity to supply wheels to Europe (in response to the heavy European Union anti-dumping duties on Chinese wheels), India (poor China-India bilateral trade relationship), and Malaysia. In exchange, CITIC Dicastal has agreed to provide technical support to Omia, which could potentially see the plant turn around faster than expected. Separately, Omia is looking to increase its production capacity to one million units per annum by 2019 from its current capacity of 750,000 units per annum. Management guided that RM13 million of capital expenditure will be allocated to new equipment and machinery for capacity expansion. We review our earnings forecasts for its 22.58%-owned associate, Perodua. The continued strong demand for Peroduaâ€™s key models lifted its market share for the first four months of 2018 to about 41% (from market share of 35% in first four months of 2017), cementing its title as Malaysiaâ€™s auto market leader. The new Perodua Myvi, launched in November 2017, had received bookings of 70,000 units with 38,000 units delivered as of the third week of April 2018. The strong associate earnings (RM36.8 million in 1QFY18, +41% year-on-year) looks sustainable, in view of the robust demand for the new Perodua Myvi, a possible hike in sales volume arising from the tax holiday (June to September 2018) and the introduction of the new Perodua SUV in late 2018. We revise up our FY18-FY20 earnings per share (EPS) forecasts by 2%-11%, factoring in: i) higher associate contributions; ii) higher volumes at the alloy wheel segment; and iii) lower steel wheel volumes. In tandem with our earnings revisions, we increase MBM Resourcesâ€™ 12-month TP to RM3.27, based on an unchanged price-earnings ratio target of 10 times on our 2019 EPS estimate. â€” Affin Hwang Capital, June 8', '6/11/2018 2:21', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Despite its recent share-price strength, we note that the stock is trading at 24 times financial year 2018 (FY18) earnings per share (EPS), which is around -1 standard deviation of its historical mean. Furthermore, the decent results for its first quarter of FY18 (1QFY18) reaffirm our investment thesis that the groupâ€™s operations are poised to pick up in FY18, as we expect the positive momentum to continue in the upcoming quarters. Our TP is at the higher end of the consensus range given that our earnings estimates are higher than consensus as we expect all its hospitals opened in the past few years to turn around by this year and we are relatively aggressive in our valuation metrics as we believe that the stock should trade closer to its implied historical mean price-earnings ratio valuation, particularly with the better earnings prospects. Potential catalysts include higher-than-expected patient volumes driven by improved healthcare affordability and stronger-than-expected profit margin due to lower input costs. We reiterate our â€œbuyâ€ recommendation for the group with a RM1.30 sum-of-parts-based TP (14 times FY18 enterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) for hospital operations and 6% yield for its 38% stake in Al-â€™Aqar Healthcare Real Estate Investment Trust. This represents a valuation of 30 times FY18 EPS, which is in line with its historical mean valuation. Key risks to our view include longer-than-expected gestation period for new hospitals. A new hospital takes around three to five years to become profitable. KPJâ€™s near-term earnings could be dragged by high start-up losses at the new hospitals, if the gestation period is longer than expected, or if its expansion plan proves to be too rapid. â€” AllianceDBS Research, June 8', '6/11/2018 2:23', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Managing director Periasamy Sinakalai believed the auditorâ€™s eleventh hour decision to qualify Tex Cycleâ€™s accounts was unnecessary and unfair. â€œThe management was pushed to a corner with no other choice but to accept the qualified report, which we are totally unhappy about. This was mainly due to the necessity to meet the Bursa reporting deadline for submission of annual report,â€ he told The Edge Financial Daily in a recent interview. The ACE Market-listed Tex Cycle is a scheduled waste recycling company that collects soiled rags, cotton fabrics, rubber, gloves, activated carbon and wood from the oil & gas, electrical & electronics, automotive, printing and other manufacturing industries. Periasamy, also known as S Perry, is a substantial shareholder of Tex Cycle with an indirect stake of 41%, held through Can Cycle Sdn Bhd. He explained that the qualification centred on the valuation of a piece of land owned by Tex Cycle. In 2005, Metro Envy Sdn Bhd (MESB), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tex Cycle, acquired a 4,823-sq-m leasehold land in Jalan Kuchai Lama, Kuala Lumpur. On Aug 16, 2016, MESB received a compulsory acquisition notice from the land office to acquire a portion of its land for the mass rapid transit (MRT) project. About three months later, a valuation report was produced by an independent valuer which was submitted to the land office to assess the compensation. Consequently, on Aug 9 last year, MESB accepted the land officeâ€™s offer of RM7 million as compensation for the compulsory acquisition of the portion of land measuring 1,040 sq m, based on the valuation by the independent valuer. As at Dec 31, 2016 and 2017, MESBÂ valued the portion of the unsold land measuring 3,783 sq m, which was listed as its investment property, at RM18.9 million, based on transacted price offered by the land office. Perry recalled that during audit committee meetings last November, as well as February and March this year, Tex Cycleâ€™s auditor Deloitte confirmed that subsequent to sufficient work performed by the audit team, the valuation was reasonable and an unqualified opinion would be issued to Tex Cycle. Therefore, the board of directors on March 15 approved the audited financial statements. However, on April 3, Deloitte made a surprise call to Tex Cycle, requesting for an independent valuation report, as the auditor was of the view that value of the investment property could be different after the compulsory acquisition. Given such short notice, Tex Cycle was unable to furnish the requested report resulting in the qualification report. â€œThe management opined that the qualified opinion was served on the company unnecessarily. It is not fair for the company to receive a qualified opinion to conceal the auditorsâ€™ oversight or safeguard them from being challenged by their peers and oversight board,â€ explained a visibly upset Perry. He further said that all relevant documents, valuation reports and managementâ€™s valuation estimation done were accepted by Deloitte since the 2016 audit, signifying the auditorâ€™s knowledge of the matter since two years ago. Not surprisingly, at Tex Cycleâ€™s annual general meeting, shareholders voted against the reappointment of Deloitte as its auditor. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia on May 16, Tex Cycle said shareholders with 99.8% of shares had voted against Deloitteâ€™s reappointment, with only 0.19% voting for it.', '6/11/2018 2:10', -1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

We wanted to learn more about the non-aeronautical side of MAHBâ€™s business and its prospects moving forward. This time around, the focus was on the development of outlet malls in Malaysia and we believe MAHBâ€™s venture into this category could be another enhancement to its long-term strategic plan of becoming an airport city. Mitsui Oulet Park is a project under MFMA Development Sdn Bhd. It is a joint venture where MAHB owns 30% and is responsible for the construction of the outlet store buildings and management of lease tenants. The other shareholder is Mitsui Fudosan Co Ltd, which owns 70%. It is located 6km from Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), which is about eight minute-drive away. The development of Mitsui Outlet Park is carried out in three phases. Upon completion, total site area will be around 178,900 sq m (1,925,664 sq ft), with retail space of 44,000 sq m. In terms of retail space, it will be 18.4% bigger in comparison with its nearest competitor and the current biggest outlet mall, Genting Premium Outlet. According to the plan, Mitsui Outlet Park is expected to offer 250 lettable outlet shops by 2021. According to the management, average rental rate stood at RM19/sq ft. Currently, the overall occupancy rate stands at 97% and is expected to ease to 95% following the completion of overall development. The tenant mix comprises luxury, international and local brands in fashion, cosmetics, sports and accessories. More offerings will be included for entertainment and amusement. The management mentioned that average footfall on weekdays/day stood at 7,000, which will double on weekends and major public holidays. As far as promotional campaigns are concerned, shops on average will offer 50% discount off the original price on weekdays, and could go up to 90% on major public holidays. Given Mitsuiâ€™s long experience in operating outlet malls, the management remains effective in providing modern facilities to visitors as well as tenants. Its primary facilities are anchored by its objective to draw the passenger traffic flow in airports (Main Terminal and klia2) to Mitsui Outlet Park. This include free shuttle buses every 20 minutes, flight information display systems around the mall, a flight check-in centre and free baggage storage services. We opine these offerings add convenience for airport shopping visitors. We opine that the outlet parkâ€™s location is its unique competitive advantage in comparison with other outlet malls in Malaysia. With regard to breakdown of visitors, the biggest portion of 65% comprises local visitors, while the remaining is foreign. On average, spending per visitor is around RM300 to RM500 per visit. Moving forward, the management of Mitsui is targeting to expand the percentage of foreign visitors to 40%. We believe this is possible given the growing trend of visitors from China, attributable to Malaysiaâ€™s visa relaxation programme. It is also important to note that Chinese tourists are ranked as the biggest spenders among tourists in Malaysia, with Taiwanese at second place. While the amount spent per customer is not disclosed, we believe that the arrival of foreign tourists is expected to stimulate more demand for outlet products. Following MAHBâ€™s venture into outlet malls with Mitsui, we noted that the revenue collection from rental is minimal, about RM3 million from lease collection. While the impact financially is minimal, we believe it enhances the long-term prospects of MAHB. In our opinion, this development will bode well for the overall objective of MAHBâ€™s Runway to Success initiatives, which are to build KLIA as a tourist destination itself. Following its strategic plan of mix development around the vicinity, this will enable MAHB to offer a more comprehensive airport experience to both domestic and international passengers. Mixed development around the land area of Malaysia airports will complement its extended function of becoming an airport city. Subsequently, we believe the company is moving in the right direction to provide more functions for travellers as well as locals who are seeking convenience. All in, our optimism about MAHBâ€™s prospects still remains. In the short term, we believe the catalyst for MAHB is the robust passenger travel.

Hence, no impact is expected on the groupâ€™s profit and loss account unless the equity stake in Laka is raised to the level for it to become an associate company of Tune Protect. This transaction is expected to be completed within three months (by early September 2018). Laka was incorporated on Jan 20, 2017, and registered in England and Wales. The company was founded by Tobias Taupitz, Jens Hartwig and Ben Allen â€” holding the largest shareholdings at 24.81%, 18.61% and 12.40% respectively. As an insurtech company, Laka offers non-conventional peer-to-peer insurance protection to members of a same community.

We are positive on the proposed acquisitions as they are yield-accretive, given the net yield of 6.8% and 6.9%, respectively (before Islamic financing cost) versus its current yield of 5.4%. The properties will be fully tenanted under fixed long-lease terms of 10 years and seven years, respectively, which further minimise the risk to Axis REIT.

The groupâ€™s gross earned contributions grew 5% to RM1.82 billion in FY17 from RM1.73 billion in FY16. For its first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (1QFY18), the figure rose 8% to RM506.28 million compared with RM470.5 million a year ago. Group chief executive officer Datuk Seri Mohd Hassan Kamil is upbeat about the groupâ€™s growth as he believes the penetration rate of takaful in the country is still low on the back of increasing medical costs, growth of the Islamic banking and finance sector, financial technology disruption, as well as the phased liberalisation of the life insurance and family takaful industry. â€œWe registered strong bancatakaful business growth [in 1QFY18], and further growth in the motor takaful contributions generated from our online sales portal called â€˜Click for Coverâ€™, as well as [saw] the expansion of our sales force to boost our growth in the family takaful and general takaful businesses,â€ he told The Edge Financial Daily via an email interview. Takaful Malaysiaâ€™s net profit for 1QFY18 rose 23% to RM69.98 million from RM56.75 million in 1QFY17, mainly due to higher net wakalah fee income. Quarterly revenue also increased 13% to RM746.17 million from RM659.84 million in 1QFY17, thanks to higher sales generated from both its family takaful and general takaful businesses. Family takaful business currently contributes 65% to the groupâ€™s revenue, while 35% is derived from the general takaful business. For the family takaful business, 55% of the revenue contribution is derived from the mortgage protection and the balance 45% from non-mortgage-related business, including employee benefits. Under its general takaful business, 47% of the revenue comes from the motor takaful business, 35% from the fire and personal accident business, and the rest from other classes. While earnings from the Indonesian operations have been less than encouraging, Mohd Hassan remains positive about the life insurance segment there, driven by the economic growth potential and the staging of regional elections that will stimulate public consumption. â€œHowever, there are constraints and limitations for takaful operators [in Indonesia], especially in terms of capital requirement to compete effectively with other general insurers. â€œThe presence of numerous takaful â€˜Islamic windowâ€™ operations in Indonesia has put the full-fledged shariah-compliant operators at a significant disadvantage compared to their competitors due to a higher operating cost,â€ he explained. On its part, Mohd Hassan said, Takaful Malaysia is providing technical support to its Indonesian operations as part of its ongoing initiatives in exploring alternatives to increase productivity. Â Going digital aggressively Takaful Malaysia is targeting to increase its market share in the domestic takaful market to 30% by 2020 from 23% now. â€œAs the takaful industry is projected to accelerate growth, outpacing its conventional counterpart, driven by innovation and digital transformation, Takaful Malaysia has been ramping up its digital strategy to meet the ever-rising consumer expectations and also stay relevant in the ongoing digital revolution,â€ said Mohd Hassan. â€œWhile affordability [of insurance products] is an issue, consumers can now opt for other alternatives such as purchasing insurance online, for example via our online sales portal â€˜Click for Coverâ€™ that offers comprehensive coverage at affordable prices,â€ he said, adding that the group will focus on leveraging its digital strategy this year by expanding its product suite to provide more options with greater convenience to customers. Currently, Takaful Malaysiaâ€™s total contribution from its online sales stands at RM40 million. While Takaful Malaysia is projecting its online sales to increase by about 20% to 25% this year, Mohd Hassan said the group does not see earnings increasing significantly, but rather it is seeking to further penetrate the market and strengthen its foothold in the industry in the next five years. Apart from embarking on digital initiatives, including system integration with its key business partners, online self-service options and a mobile application, Takaful Malaysia has three products in the pipeline: term life, critical illness and travel PA takaful. Mohd Hassan said the three products will offer a relatively lower cost of insurance, which will be more appealing and affordable to the mass market. â€œBut we are expecting minimal financial impact of these three products in 2018, taking into account our investment costs in IT infrastructure and the marketing and promotion campaigns,â€ he said. Nevertheless, he expects the group to reap greater profits with a wider network of new customer base, similar to its online motor business, in one to two years. Today, about 10% of Takaful Malaysiaâ€™s motor business comes from its online customers since the launch of its online motor product a year ago. â€œWe have started to witness increasing and greater acceptance of online motor business, and we are poised to achieve greater penetration of these three products in the near future,â€ said Mohd Hassan. â€œWe are open to both local and foreign partnerships as and when the opportunity arises,â€ he added, noting that it is part of its ongoing initiative to explore other business opportunities.

Export prices for Sarawak plywood products to Japan have risen over 10% since late last year, and further increases are on the cards. Miri-based Shin Yang group, which is Sarawakâ€™s top plywood manufacturer and exporter, had quoted higher export prices to Japan in April. For the (JAS 3x6) concrete forming panel, it was raised to about US$580 per cu metre and for coated concrete forming panel, US$680 per cu metre, according to the Japan Lumber Reportâ€™s figures quoted by International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) in its May 16-31 timber tropical market report. The new prices are between 14% and 15% higher against their respective prices of US$510 and US$590 recorded in December-2017. Besides Shin Yang, other timber companies, like Ta Ann Holdings Bhd and WTK Holdings Bhd ,are also exporting most of their plywood products to Japan.

In its June 6 report, â€œA palm storm is brewingâ€, Rabobank said the expected decrease in production is a result of declining Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFB) yield of ageing palm plantations, limited available land for expansion and insufficient replanting activities in both countries. Rabobankâ€™s senior analyst of grains and oilseeds, food and agribusiness Oscar Tjakra (pic) said that typically, it would take four years for palm to become commercially viable, yielding close to 10 tonnes of FFB per ha. It would reach its peak between nine and 17 years, and yields above 25 tonnes of FFB per ha. FFB yield would decrease below 15 tonnes per ha as palm trees became older than 25 years. â€œIn Malaysia and Indonesia, we estimate that about 36% and 9% of palm are older than 25 years.â€ The report also found that global palm oil consumption will grow at a compounded average growth rate (CAGR) of 2.8% from 2018 to 2030, with production growing only at a CAGR of 1.4%. This adds further upward pressure to palm oil prices, particularly as long-term demand from South-East Asiaâ€™s domestic market, India and Africa outstrips production. â€œIn the nearer term, the current low-price environment before 2022 could lead to a higher operational efficiency in plantation companies to reduce production costs, and accelerate consolidation in the industry,â€ said Oscar. â€œIt is important for producers to replant old plantations to boost supply in the region sustainably. Replanting programmes are also important for smallholder palm plantations, which accounted for 39% and 33%, respectively, of total palm plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia, â€œDespite short-term challenges such as potential income loss during the first three to four years of the replanting period, sustainable replanting programmes that could prevent further deforestation and land clearing, are important to boost future global palm oil production and improve productivity and welfare of smallholder farmers,â€ he said.', '6/10/2018 16:00', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Analysts say it does appear that most investors are ignoring the possibility of the current trade tensions escalating to a major trade war. Noting the resilience displayed by global equity markets, foreign exchange broker FXTMâ€™s research analyst Lukman Otunuga said the risk of a full-blown trade war has not been fully priced in. â€œMarkets could be betting on G7 members to exploit the summit in Quebec to persuade Donald Trump to reverse his steel and aluminium tariffs on three of the USâ€™ biggest trading partners,â€ Lukman said. He spoke before the summit, which brought together the leaders of the US, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan. He noted that the trade tensions between the US and its allies had increased even before similar tensions between Washington and Beijing subsided. â€œWith regard to the US-China tensions, a veil of uncertainty continues to shroud the ongoing trade drama between the two nations,â€ said Lukman. â€œThere is a risk that trade negotiations between the US and China fall apart if the US imposes tariffs up to US$50 billion (RM199.5 billion) on Chinese products.â€ On the impact of a potential full-blown trade war, he said emerging market currencies such as the ringgit will depreciate as investors offload riskier assets. â€œThe growing tension could be very bad news for oil prices,â€ he added. â€œOne of the drivers behind oilâ€™s resurgence in recent months was optimism over improving global growth boosting oil demand. With escalating trade tensions threatening economic prospects across the world, this could negatively impact demand growth from major nations and emerging markets, ultimately spelling trouble for oil.â€ Areca Capital Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Danny Wong agreed with Lukman that while investors were being cautious last Friday ahead of the G7 summit, they had yet to price in the negative risks from the escalated trade tensions. The MSCI Asia Apex 50 fell 24.28 points or 1.73% to 1,375.50 last Friday, while the FBM KLCI eased 3.66 points or 0.2% to 1,782.15. Wong believes investors will turn to a risk-off strategy if the current trade tensions worsen. Another area that will hurt investment sentiment on risky assets would be the increasing geopolitical tensions seen globally. Political uncertainties in Spain and Italy, in addition to trade pressure from Trump as well as Britainâ€™s long and difficult Brexit negotiations, also pose a risk to the European Union (EU). A fund manager with a local insurance company said that while the risk of European Union breaking apart has subsided this year compared with 2017, it is not an impossible scenario and the impact from it would hurt global economy. â€œThe worst part is that EU is not the only concern,â€ said the fund manager who could only speak on condition of anonymity as he is not the companyâ€™s spokesperson. â€œIf you look at the Middle East, there is also unrest in that region especially with the US pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal,â€ he said, adding that political uncertainties are also seen in Venezuela, Brazil, and Mexico. There is, however, a bright spot on the geopolitical front with the improvement in US-North Korea ties, and the peace summit between the two countries scheduled for tomorrow. Nomuraâ€™s global market research analyst Young Sun Kwon said the base-case view is that both countries could reach an agreement in principle at the summit. He, however, would not rule out the possibility of another last-minute cancellation or delay of the summit. Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy and market research at FXTM, also believes that the summit will dictate market focus moving forward, saying that a positive meeting could be seen as an encouragement for the stock market in Singapore as much as the major markets across the US, Europe, and nearby markets in Asia, to nudge higher. He, however, warned that in the event that the meeting takes an unexpected turn for the worse, it would be expected that there could be another period of risk aversion in the markets. Another key risk to watch out for would be the faster-than-anticipated rate hikes in the US by the US Federal Reserve (Fed), Wong from Areca noted, as foreign funds could flow back to assets deemed as safe haven. Deutsche Bankâ€™s research team has warned that higher US rates and a depreciation of their local currencies would prompt central banks in emerging markets with weak external balances such as the Reserve Bank of India, Bank Indonesia, and Banko Sentral ng Pilipinas to hike their rates more aggressively. â€œWe expect those three central banks to raise rates further in the second half, even if the US goes ahead with tariffs on US$50 billion worth of Chinese goods and China retaliates in kind,â€ Julianna Lee, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a report last week. She, however, noted that central banks of Asian emerging economies with a relatively high sensitivity to exports but with a positive external balance such as the Bank of Korea, Peopleâ€™s Bank of China, and the Bank of Thailand could delay rate hikes until signs of a durable resolution of trade disputes. A rate cut is likely to come if a trade war that would push global growth sharply weaker takes place. As for Malaysia, Lee said the relatively high government debt hints at limited fiscal stimulus but rate cuts are likely if a global trade war happens. RHB Research Institute Sdn Bhd chief Asean economist, Peck Boon Soon, expects another rate hike by Bank Negara Malaysia in the second half of the year, due to the unwinding of the US balance sheet as well as the rising interest rates by the Fed.', '6/11/2018 0:46', -1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Foreign net selling amounted to RM14.2 billion between January and May 2018, compared with net outflows of RM8.9 billion for the whole of 2017,â€ he said in an email exchange with The Edge Financial Daily. He added that the large outflows were seen particularly in April and May, with outflows totalling about RM17.6 billion for those two months. Nor Zahidi explained that the significant surge in the outflow was done ahead of Malaysiaâ€™s 14th general election (GE14) in May as foreign investors opt to stay on the sidelines while waiting for more clarity on government policies. â€œFor MGS (Malaysian government securities) alone, net foreign outflows totalled RM7.5 billion in the first five months this year, compared with net outflows of RM4 billion for the whole of 2017,â€ he noted, adding that the net foreign selling of MGS in April and May alone amounted to about RM9 billion. This would mean that foreign holdings of both MGS and the Government Investment Issue were likely to have reduced from the 45.62% and 6.68% respectively, seen in the first quarter of this year. On the recent changes seen in some of the institutions, like the resignation of Tan Sri Muhammad Ibrahim from his role as the central bankâ€™s governor, Nor Zahidi believes that it is unlikely to cause changes in the countryâ€™s monetary policy. â€œI do not think that the monetary policy direction will change significantly given that inflation is rather muted, and growth will remain relatively stable this year. In addition, the vacuum left by the governor of BNM (Bank Negara Malaysia) will not likely be too long before it is filled again,â€ he said. Maybank Kim Eng fixed income research analyst Winson Phoon agreed with Nor Zahidi that the leadership transition is not expected to translate into monetary policy risks and that there should be no deviation from the existing monetary policy path. He, however, noted that bond investors are closely monitoring the developments from here onwards. â€œThe MGS curve was little changed in reaction to the news. We have already been dealing with a lot of uncertainty and this probably doesnâ€™t add up much to the heavy news flow on changes. Also, bond investors may be somewhat relieved by earlier news that the MoF (ministry of finance) maintained its fiscal deficit target at 2.8% of GDP (gross domestic product), which alleviates supply risks in the bond market,â€ Phoon added. Â Ringgit weakness As for the ringgitâ€™s weakness, Nor Zahidi believes that it is primarily due to concerns over the reaction of international credit rating agencies (CRAs) to some of the new governmentâ€™s fiscal adjustments. Among some of those adjustments that sparked remarks by the CRAs include the zero-rating of the the goods and services tax, reintroduction of the sales and services tax as well as petroleum subsidies. â€œIn particular, CRAs are still making a careful assessment on how Malaysiaâ€™s fiscal path will look like in the medium term, whether revenue-generating measures will be announced in the near term and how the government can reduce unnecessary expenditure to offset the possible decline in revenue beyond 2018,â€ he added. Nor Zahidi believes that more clarity is required at this juncture, which left the market guessing how the CRAs would rate the countryâ€™s sovereign rating moving forward.

It is worth noting that the share price of Red Sena has gained 4.4% year to date to its last closing price of 47 sen last Thursday, despite a 6% decline from its initial public offering (IPO) price of 50 sen a share. The stock was untraded last Friday. The cash raised in its IPO that has been placed in a trust account amounted to RM391.64 million as at March 31, 2018. In the event the SPAC fails to complete a QA by the Dec 10, 2018, time frame, the amount then held in the custodian account will be distributed to the respective shareholders. This translates into 49 sen per share based on the SPACâ€™s total issued shares of one billion minus the 200 million shares held by the SPAC promoter â€” Raintree F&B Sdn Bhd, who is not entitled to the cash in the trustee account. This implies a 4.1% upside from current levels. And this has not taken into account its other receivables, deposits and prepayments of RM4.64 million, short-term Islamic investments of RM17.85 million and bank balances of RM332,535. Hence, some investors may see the recent share price weakness as a good entry level in the event the company has to be liquidated as they take advantage of the price differences. And if Red Sena manages to secure a QA, investors may enjoy its returns as a regular listed company on the local bourse. Take Hibiscus Petroleum Bhdâ€™s share price for example. It has doubled over the past year to close at 92.5 sen last Friday, bringing a market capitalisation of RM1.47 billion. When contacted by The Edge Financial Daily, Red Sena executive director and chief executive officer Joseph Tan Eng Guan declined to comment on the companyâ€™s progress in securing a QA. Red Sena, which was listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia in 2015, is one of five SPACs that have sought listing on the stock exchange. Today, Hibiscus and Reach Energy Bhd have successfully secured their QAs and are no longer a SPAC, while CLIQ Energy Bhd and Sona Petroleum Bhd had to be liquidated after failing to secure their QA within the three-year time frame. Unlike the other four SPACs that are involved in the oil and gas sector, Red Sena is the only SPAC involved in the F&B business. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia on May 22, Red Sena noted that it had yet to sign a conditional sale and purchase agreement for a QA. â€œThe two key challenges, namely, doubts surrounding deal certainty and unrealistic valuation, continue to be the major obstacles to Red Sena securing a QA,â€ added the SPAC. It also highlighted that it did not have any hot prospects other than the firm approaches it made to a handful of QA candidates that had been shortlisted. In March, after its annual general meeting, Tan said the company had been talking to more than 50 companies, but had yet to identify a suitable asset to acquire. As required under Bursaâ€™s listing rules, Red Sena has to make an appropriate announcement by end-June or early July with regard to its ability to complete a QA within the permitted time frame.', '6/11/2018 0:52', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Last Thursday, the government announced that Bernasâ€™ monopoly to import rice has been terminated. A working paper on the breakup will be drafted with feedback from the agriculture and agro-based industry ministry and other stakeholders to be submitted to the government for further action. â€œTo protect the interests of local paddy farmers, we have identified the modules used in other countries [on importing the staple], among them Indonesia, which has been successful in its approach in opening up the monopoly on rice,â€ minister Salahuddin Ayub told reporters. The president of the local unit of the UNI Malaysia Labour Centre (UNI MLC) Datuk Mohamed Shafie BP Mammal lauded the governmentâ€™s move to break the monopoly but said it is necessary to formulate a well-thought-out and comprehensive plan to ensure there is fair trade and healthy competition among the players. â€œBreaking the monopoly is a healthy move as it will encourage healthy competition. Then when there is no more monopoly, there must be a new framework. The government or minister needs to introduce a new framework which everybody understands and will benefit the rakyat, while the competition shouldnâ€™t be pinching [customers] from one another,â€ he told The Edge Financial Daily via telephone. â€œNow they (the government) want to introduce a new system so I think they must have a concrete and positive reason why they want to break the monopoly. Is it because the government thinks they cannot control Bernas or is Bernas weak?â€ said Mohamed Shafie, who is also a trade union leader involved in food and agro businesses. â€œIâ€™m not defending Bernas, but this is not something where you come today and you make a new decision for another five years. Bernas will be affected [by the governmentâ€™s decision] and they might need to retrench workers,â€ he explained. With the breaking up of the rice monopoly, independent economist Dr Chung Tin Fah said the government can save on subsidies while opening up opportunities for other players and prices can be lowered as well. â€œMonopoly is bad in [the way] that it will limit consumer choice and the monopolist set prices to earn higher than a justifiable return,â€ he said. Mohamed Shafie said Bernasâ€™ monopoly over the countryâ€™s rice supply has become a hot-button issue about unfair trade practices, but the company still face certain limitations. â€œMaybe now the government realises that there is something wrong with the import of rice and therefore they want to break the monopoly and give it (the same licence) to several other companies. Meanwhile, Socio-Economic Research Centre Sdn Bhd (SERC) executive director Lee Heng Guie said the scrapping of the rice importation monopoly would mean the liberalisation process has been set in place, allowing other players to supply in the rice market. â€œPending the detailed structure and mechanism, the proposed policy should not only result in more sharing of profits among all rice dealers but also make rice affordable to the masses as consumers have more varieties to choose from. â€œThe liberalisation of rice importation would enhance food security rather than diminish it,â€ he said in an email reply. Currently, 70% of rice demand comes from domestic producers while the balance 30% is imported from various sources, he noted. Lee believes that the rice monopoly or giving out import permits to favoured importers had not only resulted in â€œrent-seekingâ€ practices, but had also often led to high prices of rice for consumers, smuggling and arbitrage of price differentials between domestic and foreign rice. â€œRice is central to food security. It is a strategic commodity as the overall economic growth and per capita consumption depend on an adequate, affordable and stable supply of this staple crop,â€ he added. Veteran economist and former civil servant Tan Sri Ramon Navaratnam said he hopes that this is the precedent for other monopolies to be broken down. â€œThis should not be the first and only monopoly to be broken down,â€ he quipped. Bernas, the countryâ€™s sole rice importer was listed on the local bourse before it was taken private by businessman Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhary in April 2014. During that time, the privatisation was met with strong criticism amid concerns that Syed Mokhtar, who already owned many strategic assets, for instance, ports and power plants, would monopolise the import of rice. Bernas posted a pre-tax profit of RM133.39 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2016 (FY16), on a revenue of RM4.34 billion. Compared with FY15, Bernasâ€™ pre-tax profit in FY16 grew 2.6% from RM130.05 million, while revenue rose 2.8% from RM4.23 billion. Bernas is involved in the procurement and processing of paddy, importation, warehousing, distribution and marketing of rice in Malaysia, seed and farming activities, international rice joint ventures, as well as rice complementary businesses. According to its website, Bernas continued to fulfil its obligations under a privatisation agreement signed with the government in 1996. â€œThese obligations include maintenance of the nationâ€™s rice stockpile, acting as the buyer of last resort for paddy farmers, managing the Bumiputera Rice Millers Scheme and the distribution of paddy price subsidies to farmers on behalf of the government,â€ it said. On March 30, 2017 The Edge Financial Daily reported that Bernas was eyeing a relisting in 2020, a year before the expiry of its rice import concession in 2021.', '6/11/2018 0:54', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Chief executive officer for Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei Gareth McGeown told StarBiz that the company had made the accumulative investment since 2010, adding that significant infrastructure investment would continue to be made to gain market share and brand presence. â€œOur investment of RM1.5bil is inclusive of planned plant expansion to house automated warehouse with automated storage and retrieval system. We intend to help Malaysia become a halal production hub in South-East Asia. â€œOur products are halal certified and we distribute it to Singapore and Brunei which are manufactured at our plant in Bandar Enstek, Negri Sembilan. The total built-up area of the plant is 12.545ha. â€œWe have more than 300 products which are manufactured at the plant and recently has added a new production line. The company is finalising an automated warehouse, possibly the biggest in South-East Asia, scheduled to be operational in November,â€ he told StarBiz. McGeown noted that with the countryâ€™s strong economy, coupled with its young population, there is no doubt that the company would make further investments. Although there is tough competition in the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) business, he is optimistic that Coca-Cola Bottlers would be able to compete and draw customers to its products and strengthen its brand presence. â€œThe only way to move forward is to be innovative and churn out products that the customer really wants. For example, we recently launched Coca-Cola Stevia, which is 35% less sweet and Coca-Cola with zero sugar content. These products are doing well and have helped in our sales growth. At the same time, we are looking closely at consumer trends to beef up the companyâ€™s brand presence and market share,â€ he said. On talent pool, he said the company would develop local talents to help its business grow further. It has close to 1,000 employees, between the ages of 32 and 34. â€œWe see great young talents in Malaysia as the countryâ€™s average population, about 45%, consists of those below 30 years. At present, more than 90% of the companyâ€™s workforce consists of local and young talents. â€œCoca-Cola Bottlers intend to have its entire staff to be Malaysians with a strong talent pool. We have our regional team coming to Malaysia to be trained by locals and have envisioned to have Malaysian talents to be exported to our global offices,â€ he added. At the leadership level, McGeown said it was, among others, using Harvard case studies for training purposes to boost talentship in the company and to enhance their knowledge and skills in relevant areas. In terms of staff retention, he said the average turnover of employees is 3% to 4%, which is one of the lowest in the FMCG industry. â€œThe company is investing heavily on people to develop talents in various areas. If you have the best products, and a strong talent pool, there is no reason why it cannot grow and capture a bigger slice of the market,â€ he added.', '6/10/2018 16:00', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Experts have suggested ways for the government to raise additional revenue. One suggestion is for government linked investment companies (GLICs) to pare down their stakes in government linked companies (GLCs). GLICs stakes in these companies, that range from banks, conglomerates and healthcare companies, are worth billions of ringgit. Selling a small portion and divvying that up to the government could provide some relief. Alliance Bank chief economist Manokaran Mottain said this has to be done with care. â€œIt has to be done very carefully without any adverse effect on the GLICs and GLCs concerned.â€ Divesting such stakes have been done before. For instance, Khazanah Nasional Bhd, solely owned by the Ministry of Finance, sold some 90.52mil shares in CIMB Group Holdings Bhd last year. The sovereign wealth fund paid a dividend to the government of around RM1bil in 2017 from RM650mil in 2016. It also owns 40.46% in the worldâ€™s largest listed healthcare group, IHH Healthcare Bhd , valued at RM20.1bil, as well as 26.2% in Telekom Malaysia valued at RM 3.8bil as of June 8. Another suggestion was to sell overseas assets owned by the government. Rakuten Trade head of research Kenny Yee said: â€œIf you ask me, we can still breathe. It doesnâ€™t mean we are drowning. But of course if the situation arises, then overseas assets should be considered to be divested.â€ However, the timing of any such divestments is not now, according to fund manager Scott Lim. â€œThis is not the right time to start talking about selling assets. We still do not have a final picture of the financial position of the governmentâ€™s budget. â€œSelling now will mean you are selling in desperation and this will naturally mean you will not get the best price for your assets,â€ he pointed out. Instead, efforts should be focused on â€œstopping the leakages in timeâ€ and to â€œrationalise the debtâ€. The cancellation of projects will reduce about 20% of government debt, according to Manokaran. Another asset is the form of telecom spectrum. Radiowaves can be sold to telecom operators, which have given governments around the world billions of dollars. In 2015, the Thai government earned US$6.5bil by auctioning off 20Mhz of its 900Mhz spectrum. The British government sold its 3G spectrum for a whopping Â£2.5bil in 2000. According to Manokaran, Malaysiaâ€™s 700Mhz spectrum is expected to be worth about RM3.9bil.', '6/10/2018 16:00', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

This year marks the ninth consecutive year of fiscal consolidation from a peak of 6.7% in 2009. Lim, however, was confident as the government had embarked on cost structure rationalisation for projects worth RM10bil, which would result in achieving additional revenue. â€œAt the same time, we got RM5.4bil from the increase in petrol prices, as well as, better profitability from Khazanah Nasional Bhd, Petroliam Nasional Bhd and other agencies,â€ said Lim. The Finance Minister last Thursday assured fund managers of the countryâ€™s stability during a meeting with top fund managers in Malaysia, hosted by CIMB Group Holdings Bhd . â€œWe talked about prospects and fiscal measures,â€ he said, adding that the government would ensure Malaysia had a stronger current account balance.

Past correlations between the fall in world reserves and the FBM KLCI indicates a potentially volatile period ahead. World central bank reserves have fallen for the fifth week since a peak in the week ended April 27; the FBM KLCI had peaked on April 20, and had generally declined since then. The last peak for world central bank reserves was on Aug 1, 2014, following which they declined to their lowest level in January 2017; they went on a rebound that lasted until April 2018. Almost coinciding with the peak level of world central bank reserves, following the week ended July 11, 2014, the FBM KLCI had started on a general decline for a protracted period. â€œSince the dollar makes up 63% of world central bank reserves, the reduction in the Fed balance sheet will lead to a further drop in these reserves as money flows back to the United States, causing a shortage of dollars in the financial system,â€ said Pong Teng Siew, head of research, Inter-Pacific Securities. Eventually, this shows up as a fall in liquidity in the financial system; in equities, rapid sales may trigger sharp price drops. The Fed plans to lower the balance of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities by US$420bil in 2018; by up to US$600bil in 2019 and every year onwards, until it decides that â€œthe balance sheet has been normalisedâ€. Three rounds of asset purchases from 2008 to 2014 had pushed the Fedâ€™s balance sheet from US$800bil in 2006 to US$4.5 trillion. The Fedâ€™s plan to unwind its bond purchases, initiated after the 2008 financial crisis as a stimulus programme, is proceeding like clockwork, even during the sell-off in February this year. â€œIt wonâ€™t take Wall Street whining seriously until credit starts to freeze, and credit markets are far from that,â€ said Business Insider. One argument for ending these bond repurchases is in case the Fed needs to restart the bond buying programme during a future recession. Already some expect the US bond yield curve to flatten and possibly invert, in one or two years, indicating a negative outlook on the economy. Central bank chiefs of India and Indonesia had urged the Fed to slow down on its stimulus withdrawal, pointing to the huge US debt issuance, together which may cause an emerging market (EM) crisis that could also hit developed markets. Indonesia had seen investors dumping US$1.9bil of government bonds since the end of March. It had raised rates twice last month to defend its currency. Affected by the EM rout, Indiaâ€™s rupee is down 4.6% against the dollar. For the first time since 2014, India raised its benchmark rate. â€œThe US economy is on a stronger growth trajectory; it is tailoring its dollar monetary policy to the requirements of its own economy, not those of other countries,â€ said Pong. Conditions will get tighter if the European Central Bankâ€™s stimulus programme ends in September. â€œBut the magnitude of portfolio outflows this time compared with previous episodes such as during the Fedâ€™s Taper Tantrum of 2013 (when investors panicked on news that the Fed would stop repurchasing bonds) and concerns on the China economy in 2015 (when growth was weakest in 25 years). â€œCapital outflows are unlikely to trigger a broader EM crisis and contagion risks of EM asset classes associated with the weakest links in Argentina and Turkey,â€ said Lee Heng Guie, executive director, Socio Economic Research Centre. Broadly, this is due to improved fundamentals in terms of fiscal budgets, current account balances, external debt exposure and exchange rate flexibility. With more timely information, investors are regarded to be more discriminating. India and Indonesia, two victims of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, now have lower current account deficits. Will Malaysia raise rates? â€œThere is no threat of high inflation. With some adjustment and deferment of public consumption and spending, no drastic change in local rates is expected,â€ said Danny Wong, CEO, Areca Capital. â€œMonetary policy is likely to favour growth in view of lower spending in infrastructure projects,â€ said Thomas Yong, CEO, Fortress Capital. â€œThe foreign exchange market seems relatively contained amid net foreign selling of domestic equities and bonds,â€ said Lee. Will the stockmarket hold up? â€œAfter a month of adjustment, following the change in government, Bursa Malaysia is likely to revert towards the trend in regional EMs,â€ said Yong. â€œConducive business environment with better government policy will attract foreign direct investments and foreign inflows,â€ said Wong. â€œHigher earnings and expansion in price to earnings will drive the market higher.â€ Columnist Yap Leng Kuen hopes that fundamentals will prevail.', '6/10/2018 16:00', -1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

CAB, which holds a 10% stake in the joint venture, has an option to raise the stake to 30% over the next five years. Asked if it would expand the poultry business in Indonesia, Chuah said although there is huge potential in this market, the company would be cautious in its expansion plan to protect its investment. The broiler and layer farm in Indonesia would take three years to complete, he said, adding that any expansion should come after that. â€œThe collaboration with Salim Group would be the next growth phase for CAB Cakaran underpinned by the huge Indonesian market that has vast potential for the poultry industry.

The contribution in FY2019 will be gradual and it will be higher for the subsequent financial years,â€ he added. As to whether CAB Cakaran would increase its stake in the joint venture with the Salim Group, Chuah said it would depend on the companyâ€™s cash flow and financing in the coming years. â€œWe will let the construction of the broiler and layer farm to begin and the business to be in operation before deciding on the stake increase. We have five years to decide, thus we are not in a hurry.â€ On further acquisitions, he said there is a possibility, particularly in Asia. â€œWe have been on the lookout for a potential acquisition, but nothing is confirmed at the moment.

The ideal revenue contribution in the next five years would be 40%, he said, adding that the major revenue booster would be its Indonesian business. Chuah was optimistic of a better financial performance for this year as CAB Cakaran would be recognising the full revenue contribution from its subsidiary Farmâ€™s Best Food Industries Sdn Bhd, which could potentially bring in higher revenue and profit. â€œApart from this, we are expanding our production capacity, which should see an increase eventually. Our current capacity of broiler and day-old-chick stands at seven million birds and nine million birds per month respectively, which should see an increase to 7.5 million birds and 10 million birds per month by the end of 2018,â€ he said.

Investors have long focused on rewarding companies that can multiply sales in a relatively slow-growth US economy like Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc, but they are now paying more attention to figures further down the income statement like expenses and pre-tax margins. So far this year companies with high operating leverage, which allows rising revenue to boost earnings while costs stay low, have seen their share prices rise 15%, beating their peers by nearly 6 percentage points, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc data. Investors have also been rewarding companies with high and stable gross profit margins, according to the data. But a shift in investor focus may now be occurring as the impact of US corporate tax cuts encourages more spending and 10 years of ultra-low interest rates have stimulated economic growth and finally begun to push up prices and wages. Large corporate tax cuts enacted last year boosted already hefty corporate profits, making most companiesâ€™ results look better by after-tax measures, but the benefit of the tax cuts also enabled companies to spend on talent and market share, sometimes raising expenses. The other driver for investorsâ€™ increased focus on pre-tax margins may be inflation as industrial companies are forced to pay more for raw materials and companies dependent on consumer demand pay more in wages. Tom Dorsey, co-founder of Dorsey, Wright & Associates LLC, said todayâ€™s market dynamics remind him of those in the mid-1970s when he started in the investment business. US inflation skyrocketed during that decade, with oil prices spiking higher. â€œThe same kind of thing is beginning to happen,â€ Dorsey told Reuters. Investors, he said, â€œcould easily lose a lot of equity in stocks they want to hold on to because of (their dividends)â€. Take the case of Campbell Soup Co which has seen its stock fall 30% so far this year on concern that packaged goods companies are struggling to pass on higher costs to consumers through powerful distributors like Walmart Inc and following the departure in May of chief executive Denise Morrison. In its most recent quarterly earnings, the canned-soup company reported â€œhigher supply chain costs and cost inflation including higher transportation and logistics costsâ€. Another example is provided by Stanley Black & Decker Inc whose stock is off 14% year-to-date despite beating Wall Street earnings estimates. The power-tool manufacturerâ€™s chief financial officer, Donald Allan, said in April that steel, batteries and base metal prices were going to take more of a bite out of earnings than they had warned though they hope to offset those impacts by adjusting prices. Airline stocks also sank this year with crude oil prices up about 9% this year, pushing up jet fuel costs. Airline stocks tracked by Thomson Reuters Corp are down more than 7% this year. By contrast, companies who have managed to widen profit margins such as Zoetis Inc, which makes medicines for animals, Calvin Klein apparel maker PVH Corp, and agricultural product manufacturer Monsanto Co, have been rewarded with higher share prices this year. US headline consumer price inflation was 2.5% year-on-year in May and hourly earnings for private sector employees were up 2.7% from a year-ago, the Labour Department reported recently. In its May â€Beige Bookâ€ on business conditions, the Federal Reserve reported moderate price rises in most regions of the nation and noted rising materials costs in some districts that are putting pressure on transportation, construction and manufacturing. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates again at its policy meeting on Wednesday as inflation and unemployment have come closer to the central bankâ€™s targets but it will likely also keep an eye on corporate profit margins. Tough talk on tariffs on imported goods by US President Donald Trump, and potential retaliation by China and other countries, may also push up consumer prices further. A stronger US dollar so far this year may restrain imported inflation, but a rising greenback typically does more to curtail exports by making them more expensive than it does to tamp down inflation by cheapening imports, according to 2015 Boston Fed research. â€œEveryone is focused on interest rates.

And Malaysia, being a renowned halal food manufacturing hub, has seen various global food players making a beeline to set up their bases here.The interest in the local market is also, in part, due to Malaysiaâ€™s strategic gateway to the South-East Asian market. With a sizeable population and rising living standards, the Asean region is marked as one of the major growth drivers for the bread and baked food market. This, in turn, increases demand for the baking ingredients market.The positive development in the industry can be seen through the gradual reduction of import tax on baking products in the Asean region.While this is good news to baking ingredients manufacturers and suppliers, Harvest Bakery Ingredients export manager Lim Teck Hwa notes that consumers in this region have a diverse taste portfolio and preferences. For Lim, this presents both opportunities and challenges.As it stands, there are already a number of large European-based companies that have started or are in the process of starting their manufacturing operations in Malaysia. Some of Harvest Bakeryâ€™s notable foreign competitors with base in the country include AB Mauri and Bakels.Most local manufacturers are also active in the regional confectionery market. They offer good distribution expertise and local connections. In Malaysia, the bulk of the bakery ingredients manufacturers and suppliers are located in the Klang Valley, Melaka and Johor. They are well equipped with modern technology to apply the latest methods, save costs and improve productivity.Innovation by producers also play a great role in ensuring new products drive market growth. The improved transportation and logistics also help in expanding the business network to achieve greater market penetration.Rather than compete head on with the international brands, which have much bigger scale and capital, that have set up shop locally, Lim says Harvest Bakery prefers to grow their market in the international arena. After all, there is more value in knowing that your products are acknowledged in the other parts of the region than just at home.', '6/10/2018 16:00', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),
('C718179E-2B57-48E6-9086-2FEF9031A90B', 'THESTARE-BUSINESS', 'http://www.thestar.com.my/business/smebiz/2018/06/11/continuing-the-bountiful-harvest/', 'Continuing the bountiful harvest', 'Bakery ingredients maker maintains its innovative streak amidst growing competition LIM Teck Hwa speaks fondly of the tenacity, passion and proud sense of ownership that his father, Lim Keem Kok â€“ the founder of Harvest Bakery Ingredients â€“ has for the company. The business started from a small shop lot in 1985 making flavour emulsions for cakes. Keem Kok had a pioneering mindset when it came to building the business. He believed that innovation is the key in moving the company forward. The quest to improve its products saw Harvest Bakery coming out with many firsts for the then nascent bakery ingredients industry here, including being the first manufacturer in the country to manufacture coloured and flavoured Imolko. Growing demand: The companyâ€™s total production stands at 3,000-3,500 tonnes of products annually.Â Â With the success of the emulsion, the enterprising Keem Kok travelled to Europe and the US to learn more about the industry and to source for more quality bakery ingredients. This led to its next product range, the Sponge Cake Mix with ingredients sourced from Europe. The elder Lim is particularly mindful of the fact that Harvest Bakery has come a long way to be one of the manufacturers with the most complete range of bakery ingredients. Harvest Bakery has now established its name as a major supplier in the industry. It supplies bakery ingredients to bakery chains, hotels, supermarkets, food manufacturers as well as wholesalers. â€œWe are carrying Malaysiaâ€™s flag as far as bakery ingredients are concerned. There is no similar company from Malaysia that supplies and manufactures the entire chain of bakery ingredients like we do. â€œToday, we have the capacity to produce over 200 varieties of ingredients from over 20 different product ranges, including premix baking powder, butter blends and margarine, ganache, fondant, pastes and chocolate spreads under our own brands. If you like cakes, chances are you have eaten or bought one that contains some of our ingredients,â€ says Teck Hwa. The companyâ€™s signature product, chocolate Imolko, is still one of Harvest Bakeryâ€™s bestselling products. It is mainly used for flavouring buns, cakes, creams and other baking products. Going retail: The company is eyeing the retail market and hopes to introduce smaller-sized packaging for home use.Â Harvest Bakeryâ€™s Imolko quickly caught on among the network of bakery and cake shops in the country for its aroma and taste. With the baton now passed on to Keem Kokâ€™s sons, Teck Hwa says he and his two other siblings are now responsible to take the business to the next level. That role includes expanding the companyâ€™s market reach and establishing strategic partnerships, which is the focus of Teck Hwa as the export manager. His elder brother Lim Teck Guan is the companyâ€™s managing director, while his other brother, Lim Teck Wee, takes care of production, warehousing facilities and the factories. Expanding exports While the business is established, Teck Hwa acknowledges that the industry landscape is changing all the time, and Harvest Bakery cannot afford to rest on its laurels. It needs to continue seeking new innovation and maintain high product quality to stay in the game. Teck Hwa says Harvest Bakery is operating in a matured industry. Apart from a multitude of local players, it also faces competition from large multinationals that are setting up production bases in Malaysia to penetrate the Asean and Asian markets. However, regional countries such as the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and even Singapore still offer growth potential and will be the main growth driver for the company in the future, notes Teck Hwa. Export markets, mainly to Singapore and Brunei, currently make up less than 20% of the companyâ€™s total sales. Harvest Bakery is also looking into a possible expansion into the retail market with products such as its premixes, butter and margarine and other bakery ingredients, by introducing smaller-sized packaging. Confectionery props: Some of the decorations produced by the company used for cakes.Â Â At the moment, its bakery powders, premixes and emulsifiers are the main revenue generators for the company. Its other major products include baking and cooking chocolates under the Tropica Compound Chocolate brand, margarine under the Buttermas label, Butter-Blend and Latifolia Margarine Emulsion, chocolate Imolko and coffee Imolko. Harvest Bakery is also involved in trading of imported baking or compound chocolates, jams and flavourings for the bakery and pastry market. Business is growing and the company is bursting at the seams. It currently has two running operation centres, comprising a manufacturing plant and an office cum warehouse. â€œWe have run out of space with our three buildings, which occupy some 1.5 acres of land. We will be investing in a new 1.2acre plant near our current location. Investment for the new building is estimated at around RM17mil. This is to expand and improve our production capacity, quality and for new product lines,â€ says Teck Hwa. The companyâ€™s total production stands at around 3,000-3,500 tonnes annually, excluding trading products. On average, the company currently records a turnover of around RM5mil per month, or about RM60 annually. Depending on the seasonal demand for bakery ingredients, Teck Hwa foresees growth of around 3%-5% per annum. New demand trends The size of Malaysiaâ€™s bakery industry is estimated to be worth around RM2bil annually. Cakes are one of the staple desserts for locals and appear on the table in almost every occasion. Thus, cakes are widely seen as a stable and recession-proof business. However, Teck Hwa cautions that ingredient manufacturing is neither a high-growth nor a high-margin venture. He points out that cakes are categorised as foods that are rich in sugar and a growing number of health-conscious consumers are looking for healthier alternatives. He also notes a rising trend among consumers in markets such as Singapore towards gluten-free bakery products and pastries with less sugar content. Still innovating: The company invests heavily in R&D to improve its products in keeping with market trends.Â Â Some of the future demand in the market, he expects, will be trans-fat free-, multigrain- and whole grain-based baked goods that are low fat, low calorie, organic and enriched with vitamins and minerals with added flavours. Consequently, Teck Hwa says the company has been looking at developing products of a healthier variety. Future investments, therefore, must focus on enhancing the companyâ€™s capabilities in these products. Innovation, a legacy of his father, is still very much at the heart of the companyâ€™s development. And Harvest Bakery has been investing in R&D as well as on testing and quality control to ensure its products are tip top and improved with the times. Every ingredient and product is tested and verified to be free-of-contamination by its in-house scientist to ensure safety and product quality, Teck Hwa adds. According to him, there is a risk of quality control slipping out of their hands. Some of these products, he explains, are resold in different packaging to end customers or are added into their own range of products in the outlets. As much as it tries, this makes it difficult for the company to monitor the quality of the products that end up in the hands of end users. Going forward, Teck Hwa says Harvest Bakery will consider potential tie-ups with private equity or strategic investors to help fund its expansion plans. It was previously approached by a Dutch company and Australian-based investors two years ago but the management had decided then that Harvest Bakery was not ready to give up its stake as there was still room to grow on its own, he says. At the moment, Harvest Bakery is fully owned by the Lim family. Nonetheless, Teck Hwa says the company may consider forming strategic partnerships in another â€œone to two yearsâ€™ timeâ€ should there be any potential synergies and market access opportunities as the company looks to expand its production capacity, ramp up its R&D and penetrate new export markets.Related story:Growing appetite in regional bakery market', '6/10/2018 16:00', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

According to findings of the Asean SME Transformation Study by United Overseas Bank (UOB) and Dun & Bradstreet, 65% of Malaysiaâ€™s SMEs will focus their investments on technology over other fixed assets in 2018 to drive business performance and remain competitive. This echoes the direction of other Asean SMEs where three in five (60%) prefer technology over investments in assets such as factories and machinery. A majority of Malaysiaâ€™s SMEs surveyed, some 78%, also say they would invest specifically in software such as improving their websites and creating mobile apps. They believe such innovations would enable them to create better customer experience and increase customer loyalty. Hardware and infrastructure investments rank second for local SMEs (77%) and across the region (65%). â€œWhile SMEs see the need to innovate, they have also been cautious about adopting cutting-edge applications, relying instead on current tools such as licensed software, customer relationship management, and content and database management. â€œNevertheless, increasing disruptive offerings such as robotics process automation, artificial intelligence and 3D printing have begun to pique the curiosity and interest of SMEs to drive business performance,â€ says Chow Sang Hoe, partner at Ernst & Young Advisory Services Sdn Bhd and EY Asean and Malaysia advisory leader. He notes that the government has encouraged growth and productivity through greater automation, particularly in the manufacturing sector. â€œThis can be achieved by the digitising of factories which is beyond just a step-up in automation and deployment of new technologies. New digital factory systems will be far more inter-connected and powered by a completely different data ecosystem driven by big data, analytics and physical technology. Most importantly, these technologies support mobile devices such as our smartphones,â€ he adds. As businesses continue to expand their digital exploits, there is an increasing demand for talent with experience in digital. Data specialists and analysts, user experience or interface designers, and digital marketers are highly sought to help these businesses transform effectively for the digital economy. â€œThe government is determined to focus on technology-based education, a key factor in building an effective long-term pipeline of talent for the digital economy. There is also a push to tackle the talent challenge for SMEs through productivity and capability development programmes,â€ says Chow. Despite the focus on technology, Chow points out that SMEs are not aware of how efficiently pay-per-use or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) can address their business needs. SaaS refers to web-based software that can be used to manage business processes such as accounting, invoicing and payroll. The survey notes that SaaS is a more cost-effective option for small businesses than traditional licensed software as it provides users the flexibility to pay only for what they use and to scale the solution based on their business needs. As small businesses expand, they can add on new functionalities or increase the number of users for their existing solution without the need for further significant investments. The survey also indicated that SMEs generally have an optimistic outlook despite global economic headwinds and challenges such as rising costs, flagging productivity and not harnessing new technologies. About 54% of the Malaysia respondents anticipate revenue growth this year, while about a quarter project a double-digit expansion. This optimism is highest among SMEs in the manufacturing, wholesale, mining and transportation sectors. Additionally, 44% of Malaysia SMEs have ambitions for overseas expansion, fairly higher than the regional average of 37%. â€œBusiness sentiment among Malaysian SMEs remain positive, enhanced by government support in terms of financial access and push for digitisation and innovation. Targeted initiatives such as manpower and infrastructure upgrade programmes in higher value-added sectors, tax incentives, grants and loans will continue to further propel the growth and resilience of local SMEs. â€œThe new administration is also committed to ensuring a stable ringgit and a vibrant stock market as well as strengthening governance and institutions. All of these are positive steps towards boosting investor confidence in the long run and will play a critical role in enhancing cross-border trade across the region as well as Malaysiaâ€™s competitiveness in the worldâ€™s marketplace,â€ concludes Chow. As part of the study, EY provided insights via an industry survey of 1,235 SMEs across Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam to understand how Asean SMEs are positioning themselves to participate in the regionâ€™s growth and adapt to the changes ahead.', '6/10/2018 16:00', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

However, this will be anchored on a â€œprudent approachâ€, as the company continues to pare down its debt burden and strengthen the balance sheet, said its chief executive officer Leon Harland. According to him, the company is seeing a rapid increase in requests from clients for tenders, in particular for floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels. â€œYet, we maintain a clear and targeted approach for new tenders. â€œWe want to focus only on new projects that will fit well with our capabilities and these projects must have strong project fundamentals such as good clients, attractive overall project economics and oil reservoir characteristics,â€ he told StarBiz. In this context, Harland confirmed that the company has been pursuing FPSO for Eniâ€™s Zaba Zaba development project offshore Nigeria for quite some time. â€œWe do know the client very well through our successful Olombendo project in Angola, but this is not the only project that we are working on,â€ he said in email replies. About a month ago, Upstream reported that Bumi Armada was the frontrunner for the Zaba Zaba FPSO with a bid valued at US$7.62bil (RM30.32bil), beating the Bluewater Offshore-Saipem joint-venture that offered US$5.42bil. The O&G field is operated by Eniâ€™s Nigerian Agip Exploration Ltd, which has a 50% interest, while Shell has the remaining 50% stake. However, legal disputes have troubled the development. High local content requirements in Nigeria also increase the risk of cost overruns for the FPSO project, said analysts. Harland admits that O&G projects of this magnitude come with large investment requirements and require multiple stakeholders to be aligned. â€œSo, we are well aware that the timeline for the project sanction can easily slip and, therefore, we are prudent in this sense,â€ he said. Bumi Armada, whose order book currently stands at RM22.3bil, has not bagged a new FPSO contract since 2014. For the short-term, Harland said the company would focus on safe and reliable operations for all its vessels and to ensure clients pay. â€œWe want to finalise our new large floating production projects in the United Kingdom and Angola and gear up for growth, which we expect from new floating production and operation projects and new subsea construction contracts for our vessels in the offshore marine services (OMS) business unit.â€ Oil prices now hover above US$70 a barrel, up more than US$20 per barrel from a year ago and US$40 more from the bottom of the oil bust in early 2016. In the recent first quarter ended March 31 (1Q18), the companyâ€™s net profit came in flat year-on-year (y-o-y) at RM48.42mil. Revenue rose 48.5% to RM600.34mil, with the bulk of earnings derived from overseas. Meanwhile, borrowings stood at RM10.86bil as at that period. UOB HayKian noted that although earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation - which is a measure of a companyâ€™s operating performance - improved y-o-y from RM221mil to RM325mil in 1Q18, there was a RM224mil investing cash outflow for the companyâ€™s 20% equity investment in the joint-venture FPSO Karapan Armada Sterling III. The vessel received 100% rate recognition at the end of last year. This reduced cash balance from RM1.8bil to RM1.5bil. The research firm said its cash flow forecasts assumes no new project wins, which implies a very low capex outflow of below RM0.3bil per year mainly for OMS/FPSO maintenance. Without giving details, Harland said the company was exploring various funding and balance sheet options. â€œWe are not looking at cash calls in the context of supporting our current ongoing operations. â€œHowever, seeking shareholder support could be interesting if that support can be allocated for investment into new large projects that boost growth,â€ he added. Monetisation of assets (including FPSO stakes) and strategic partnerships are options being explored by Bumi Armada should it win new FPSO projects, said analysts. The company, which is majority controlled by tycoon T. Ananda Krishnan, is also said to be considering medium-term notes issuance to refinance its current borrowings base. Shares in Bumi Armada closed one sen down to 74 sen on Friday with a market capitalisation of RM4.37bil.', '6/10/2018 16:00', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Malaysia Rail Link Sdn Bhd (MRL) said information in an English language weeklyâ€™s article titled Jho Lowâ€™s Handiwork, was completely incorrect and misleading. MRL said the claim that the ECRL contract came with a clause requiring the China Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC) to nominate a company unrelated to it to buy 70% of Putrajaya Perdana Bhd for US$244mil as well as 90% of Loh & Loh for US$71mil was a baseless and irresponsible allegation. â€œThere is no contract between CCCC and MRL that stipulates this clause. Neither does this clause appear in the loan agreement between MRL and the Export-Import Bank of China. â€œAs the project owner of the 688km ECRL, the inaccurate information presented in the said article potentially ruined the reputation of MRL and its cordial relationship with CCCC, the main contractor of the project,â€ MRL said in a statement issued by its corporate communications department yesterday. MRL said realisation of the long overÂ­due ECRL infrastructure project was done based on a government to government (G2G) agreement. â€œIt mooted the setting up of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) company to oversee its implementation. â€œMRL was incorporated on Sept 26, 2016, and following that only the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning contract with CCCC and the loan agreement with Export-Import Bank of China is within our purview with regards to the ECRL project,â€ it explained. MRL also said progress of the ECRL project has reached 14.33%, which includes setting up of base and satellite camps in all eight sections of the project, land acquisition, site clearing and construction of road access. Multiple road access totalling some 95km in length and temporary bridges spanning 1,067m have been constructed at many of the ECRL project sites in the east coast states, it said. â€œA key catalytic project, the ECRL is progressing slightly ahead schedule and is on track for completion and operation by mid-2024. â€œAs of now, the construction works for seven tunnels in various parts of the rail alignment in Pahang and Terengganu have commenced. â€œPreparatory works for South-East Asiaâ€™s longest rail tunnel â€“ the 16.3km Genting tunnel is also in progress. â€œThe tunnel boring machines for the twin-bore Genting tunnel is expected to arrive this November to facilitate tunnelling works between Bentong and Gombak,â€ it said. MRL added that it trusts the Federal Government will soon make an informed decision on the best course of action regarding the ECRL project. â€œMeanwhile, we continue to provide information to the Federal Government in their review of the project,â€ it said.', '6/10/2018 16:00', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

There was no official announcement of her departure as deputy governor and her name was discreetly removed from the central bankâ€™s organisation chart on its website. If Nor Shamsiahâ€™s appointment as Bank Negara governor is approved by the King, she would make a triumphant return to the central bank which was her home for 30 years before she left on Nov 15, 2016. Her departure was amidst a clampdown by the previous government on people who were investigating the trail of money that flowed out of 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB). Sources said the last day of outgoing governor, Tan Sri Muhammad Ibrahim, is this Friday, which could also be the first day of Hari Raya. Muhammad had tendered his resignation last Wednesday after questions were raised on the central bankâ€™s purchase of a land from the federal government for RM2bil. The transaction was completed in January this year and the proceeds were used to pay 1MDBâ€™s debts. After leaving Bank Negara, Nor Shamsiah joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in April last year where she was based in Washington DC. She was the assistant director of Monetary and Capital Markets Department there. There is no official statement by the IMF stating that Nor Shamsiah has resigned but sources in the banking industry indicated that she has left the international monetary body. So far it is not known if the consent has been sought from the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong to appoint Nor Shamsiah as the governor. Under Section 15 of the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the governor shall be appointed by the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong for a term of five years. During Nor Shamsiahâ€™s stint in Bank Negara, she was involved primarily in overseeing and ensuring the health of the banking sector, which is the core responsibility of the central bank in ensuring financial stability in the system. Apart from banks, her area of supervision covered insurance and takaful companies, financial intelligence and enforcement, and talent management. It was her oversight on the banks that saw her spearhead the investigations into 1MDB at the central bank level. Nor Shamsiah was also involved in the financial sector resolution initiatives during the Asian financial crisis and the preparation and implementation of the Financial Sector Masterplan from 2001 to 2010. Apart from Shamsiah, another former deputy governor of Bank Negara â€“ Sukudhew (Sukhdave) Singh â€“ was speculated to be making a comeback to the central bank. However Sukhdave when contacted said he was not aware of anything to that effect. â€œIâ€™m retired and if there is any truth to the rumours you mentioned, I am not aware of it,â€ he said. Both Nor Shamsiah and Sukhdave are known to be loyalists of Tan Sri Zeti Akhtar Aziz. The Act also provides for up to three deputy governors for the central bank. There are now only two â€“ Shaik Abdul Rasheed Abdul Ghaffour and Jessica Chew Cheng Lian. Sukhdaveâ€™s last day with the bank was on Dec 31 last year. Before his departure from Bank Negara, he delivered a parting shot, saying that his life in the bank has been based on certain professional expectations and when he found himself put in circumstances where those expectations can no longer be met, there was no other decision for him but to leave. He had said in his e-mail to Bank Negara staff last November that when one was in a position of leadership, they have to remind themselves that leadership was a responsibility and not a privilege.', '6/10/2018 16:00', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

However in the short term, uncertainty remains until the new governmentâ€™s programmes and policies are clearer. Value Partners Group co-founder and chairman Datuk Seri Cheah Cheng Hye felt that the initiatives of the new government have earned Malaysia tremendous goodwill from foreign investors. But he does not expect to see foreign investors rushing to buy Malaysian stocks. â€œI think foreign investors are actively exploring investment opportunities. But generally there is still a wait-and-see attitude and an air of uncertainty over how the new government will go about its programme of improvements,â€ Cheah told StarBiz. He said the concern of investors is that the government would face difficulty in filling in the gap in revenue caused by the zerorisation of the goods and services tax on a long-term basis. â€œI donâ€™t see significant upside for Malaysian stocks this year. The market will be volatile and stocks donâ€™t look particularly attractive. â€œForeign investors also need to regain confidence in the value of the ringgit,â€ said Cheah, who helps oversees some US$17.9bil under Value Partners. The FBM KLCI was down 1.25% on a year-to-date basis to 1,774.41 on Friday. As of last week, Malaysian equities experienced the fifth week of foreign selling, the longest selling binge recorded so far this year. For the month of May, foreigners withdrew RM5.6bil net, the highest monthly outflow in 2018 thus far. Meanwhile, the year-to-date outflow from Malaysia is RM2.12bil. David Gaud, the Asia chief investment officer of the US$220bil Pictet Wealth Management has been buying Malaysian stocks after Pakatan Harapanâ€™s unprecendented election win last month, even though foreigners dumped them for five straight weeks. He is bullish about Malaysia because of higher oil prices, a recovering currency and a quickly narrowing deficit. â€œPrime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad is lucky. He is able to implement a new policy at a time when the economy is recovering. Heâ€™s got a chance to succeed,â€ said Gaud. Ang Kok Heng, chief investment officer at Phillip Capital Management Sdn Bhd said what he saw recently was a stronger ringgit and foreign funds pulling out of emerging markets. â€œThe May sell-down by foreign funds are related to the zerorisation of GST that may cause the budget deficit to worsen. The hidden Government loans under guarantees and financial leases also remind foreign investors of the governmentâ€™s gearing. The everyday net sellers reflect that,â€ he said. The government has announced that it would be able to maintain its fiscal discipline despite not implementing the GST that was supposed to contribute RM42bil to the Federal Government coffers. The revenue shortfall due to the zerorisation of the GST for this year is estimated at RM21bil. Last week, Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said the shortfall of RM21bil would be covered by a cut in expenditure, increased dividends from government linked companies and collection of sales and service tax. Lim has said that the Federal Government budget deficit would remain at 2.8% of the economy. Ang said that the market was in better shape under the new Pakatan Harapan government than the old government and noted that the local funds were supporting the market. â€œI think our market is definitely in better shape under the new government than under the old government. So over the long term, the market will be positive. Over the short term, we need to wait for the Pakatan Government to show results from the reforms,â€ Ang said Cheah, who started as a journalist with The Star in the 1970s in Penang and went on to become a successful fund manager in Hong Kong, had previously said that Malaysia has huge potential and opportunities but it needs structural reforms. On the new government, Cheah said that Malaysiaâ€™s leaders are not magicians. They need time, unity and some luck to overcome the many problems that have piled up in the country, he added. â€œThe challenges include a legacy of corrupt practices, a rapid increase in government debt and structural inefficiencies as well as social issues in the country,â€ he said. In the past, Cheah has also been open about his views on the brain drain issue in Malaysia and how Malaysia has fallen behind in the competitiveness ranking. He felts this needed to be addressed now. â€œThe big risk for the economy is that it remains stuck in a middle-income trap, especially if solutions cannot be found to the longstanding problems of a brain drain and capital flight. An estimated two million Malaysians now live overseas,â€ he said. On top of that, the Malaysian stock market is not particularly cheap, trading at a price earnings ratio of 16, which is slightly above its historical average, said Cheah. Nonetheless it is not all bad news, as there are positive factors too. For instance, the economy is projected to grow at around 4.5% this year, which is a healthy rate, although it is down from 4.9% last year. Exports are also growing nicely, helped by higher oil prices. â€œMost importantly, the change of government has given new hope to people both within and outside the country. We only need to get a few important things right, and investors will find their way here,â€ said Cheah. Cheah hopes that the leaders of Pakatan Harapan realise that winning the election â€“ even though itâ€™s a stunning achievement â€“ is only the first step in a long journey to rebuild Malaysia. â€œIt wonâ€™t be easy and investors know this â€“ thatâ€™s why many prefer to wait and see. The real test may come by next year when Pakatanâ€™s honeymoon period is over. At that time, the financial markets will start asking difficult questions,â€ he said.', '6/10/2018 16:00', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00');
